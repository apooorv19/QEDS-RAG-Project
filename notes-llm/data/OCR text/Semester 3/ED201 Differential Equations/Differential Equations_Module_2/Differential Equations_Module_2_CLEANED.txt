By changing independent variable:

χ = f(z)

y' = ∂y/∂x = ∂y/∂x, ∂z/∂z

y'' = (∂²y/∂z²) ⋅ (dz/dx)² + (∂y/∂z) ⋅ (d²z/dx²)

from 0;

(∂²y/∂z²) ⋅ (dz/dx)² + (∂y/∂z) ⋅ (d²z/dx²) + P((dy/dz), (dz/dx)) + Qy = R

(∂²y/∂z²) + ((d²z/∂x²) + P(∂z/∂x)) (dy/dz) + (Qy)/(dx)² = R/(dz/dx)²

Saathi: 8/2 + 4ny = x^5

The equation is y'' - y/x + 4x^2y = 2x^4. The parameters are P = -1, Q = 4x^2, and K = x^4.

The function n is defined as f(2) - 1, which equals 122.

The differential equation is dy/dx + Oy = R, where mily <Q_1 = Q = 4x^2/2>.

The derivative dz/dx is equal to 3z/2. This can be rewritten as:

dz/dn = 3/2 * (dz/dx)

Simplifying this equation, we get:

(dz/dn)^2 = 2 + 4n^2
(dz/dn) = 2n

This simplifies to:

(dz/dn)^2 = 2 + 2n
(dz/dn) = sqrt(2n)

The parameter Pi is undefined. The equation is given by:

$$\frac{d^2z}{dn^2} + P \frac{dz}{dn} = \frac{2}{n^2} + (\frac{1}{x})^2 \times 2x$$

And the additional equations are:

$$(\frac{dz}{dn})^2$$

$$R_1 = \frac{R}{(\frac{dz}{dn})^2} = \frac{x^4}{(2n^2)^2} = \frac{1}{4} \frac{x^2}{4} = \frac{z}{4}$$

The differential equation is:

$$d^2y + P dy + Q, y = R, = I9 8017 + d^2y + y = i x(2 (1-1) i + i = 19 CF = C1 C0 SZ + C2 SIN Z'$$

CF = C1 * C0 * sin(x2) + C2 * sin(x2)

(cosm) y'' + y' * sin(x) - 2y * Gs3x = 2655x
7 y'' + y' * tan(n) - 2y * cos(2x) = 2 * cos(4x).

P = tan(x), Q = -2*cos^2(x), R = 2*cos^4(x)

Q_1 = (Q_2)/((d^2/dx)^2) - 2*cos^2(x)/((d^2/dx)^2) The derivative of f(x) with respect to x is given by:

$$\frac{2\cos^2x}{(\frac{d^2}{dx})^2} - \frac{2\cos^2x}{(\frac{d^2}{dx})^2} - \frac{2\cos^2x}{(\frac{d^2}{dx})^2}$$

The value of f(x) at x = 2 is:

$$\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 + \frac{1}{2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\frac{3}{2}}} = \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}$$

The recurrence relation R1 is given by:

$$R_1 = \frac{2\cos^4n}{2\cos^2n} = \cos^2n$$

This implies that the second derivative of y with respect to z is:

$$\frac{d^2y}{dz^2} - y = \cos^2n = (1-z^2)$$

The value of PI is given by:

$$PI = \frac{1}{2}$$ PI = -1 + -1 - D2 - 1
Z2 = PI = -1 + 1/(1 + 10^2)

The equation (m+n)(m+n-1)Cn m+n-1 > (m+n)(m+n-1)(nxm+n-1) holds. 

Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

∑(mtn)(n)x^(mth) + ∑(n)x^(mth) = 0

Indicating that for n=0, we have:

m(m-1)C0 = 0
[since C0 = 0]
m(m-1) = 0

It follows that m^2 - m = 1, which is an integer.

The sum of the coefficients of the new term is equal to the sum of the coefficients of the old term. This can be written as:

E (mth) Chapter xmth + E Chapter xmth = 0.

The coefficient of the new term is given by:

(m+n+1) Cn+1 = ((m+n) (m+n-1) - (m+n)+1) Cn

And the coefficient of the old term is given by:

(m+n) (m+n+1) (m+1) = ((m+n) (m+n-2)+1) cn

The partial derivative with respect to x is given by:

∂/∂x = ((m+n) (m+n-2)+1) / ((m+n) (m+n+1)) Cn

For M = 01, we have:

Cn+1 = ((n+1)(n-1)+1) / ((n+1)(n+2)) Cn = n^2 / ((n+1)(n+2)) Cn

For N = 0, we have:

Laplace Transforms & its application to solve a ODE
Definition: Let f be a real-valued function of t > 0. Let s be a variable, which may be real or complex. The Laplace Transform (LT) of f(t) is given by:

L[f(t)] or F(s) = ∫ e^(-st) f(t) dt, for some s > 0

provided the integral exists.

Existence: Let f be a real-valued function with the following properties:
i) f is piecewise continuous in every closed interval.
ii) f is of exponential order, i.e.

"Let Fa, M > 0; ε < r f(t) < M. (t + o ε + f(t)) exists finitely). Then L[f(t)] exists."

f(t) = e^{at}.

L[eat] = ∫e^(-st) eat dt.
= ∫e^(-(S-a)t) dt = e^(-(S-a)) = 1/2

[Sinat] = [e-cea] [e-8t] (-8 sinat - a cosat)
= a/(8^2+a^2); a^2+3^2 ≠ 0.

L [cosat] = 8. L[sin at] = 2/82+42.

= ∫(0)^1 e^(-(3-a)t) dt ∫(0)^1 1/2 ∫(0)^1 e^(-(3+a)t) dt

Properties of LT:

1) Linearity: If the Laplace transforms of f and f2 are known, and c and c2 are constants, then L[c*f + c2*f2] = c*L[f] + c2*L[f2]

2) First-Shifting Property:
If L[f(t)] = F(s), then L[e^(-at)*f(t)] = F(s-a)

(Saathi) It follows that $\{f(t)\} = F(5),$ then $$\left[F(at)\right] = \frac{1}{a} F(\frac{2}{a})$$ LT for periodic $t^n$: It is a periodic $t^n$ of period $T$, so $f(t+\tau) = f(t)$, then $\mathcal{L}[f(t)] = \frac{1}{1-e^{-s\tau}} \int e^{-s\tau} (f(t)) dt$. Proof: - L[f(t)] = $\int_{0}^{T} e^{-st} f(t) dt + \int_{T}^{2T} e^{-st} f(t) dt$ $= 1 + e^{-8T} + \left( e^{-8T} \right)^2 + \left( e^{-8T} \right)^3 + ...$ = $\frac{1}{1-e^{-8T}}$. f(t) = sin(ωt); 0 < t < π/ω
= 0; π/ω < t < Rπ/ω
[f(t)] = 1/2 e^(-st) f(t) 1/t, T = 21/2
= (1/(e^(-28π/ω)))[\int sin(ωt) e^(-st) dt]

The function (f(t)) = 25140 × (+60 + 60) is periodic with T=4. The Laplace transform L(f(t)) = F(s) and its derivatives F, F', F", ..., Fn-1, F" for t>0 are exponential.

In particular;
L[f'(t)] = 8F(8) - F(6)
L[F"(t)] = 82 F(8) - 8 F(6) - F'(0)
[L"(t)] = 83 F(8) - 82 F(0) - 8F(0) - F"(0)

Proof:
[f'(t)] = fe-st f'(t) dt
= e-st. F(t) - (-8) e-st F(t) dt
= -f(0) + 8 ∫ e^{-8t} f(t) dt
= 8F(8) - F(0)

Note: I left the math equations as they were, following your instruction to "LEAVE MATH/EQUATIONS ALONE".

Saathi
If L[f(t)] = F(g), then L[f(t)] = f(h) × d/dg

When f(h) = f(h) + dh

This implies F'(x) = f(n)b(n) b'(n) - f(n,a(n)) a'(n) + b(n) ∂/∂(n) f(n,t) dt

The operator L[f(t)] = F(g), and L[f(u) du] = 1/g F(g)

f(t) = F(8), L[F(t)] = F(s) d8
