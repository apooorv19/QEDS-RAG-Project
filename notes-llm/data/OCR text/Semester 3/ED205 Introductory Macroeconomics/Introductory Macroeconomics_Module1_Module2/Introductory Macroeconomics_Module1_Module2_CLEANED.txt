National Income Accounting:

Gross National Income (GNI): Value of all final goods and services produced in the country within a given period.

Intermediate Goods: An Intermediate Good is used during the same period in which it was produced.

Examples:

1. Wheat - Flows -> Bread
	* Value Added: 50 + 25 + 25 = 100
	* Value of IG = 75

Example 2:
Farmers to Wheat: Rs. 4,500,000
Miller: Flows Rs. 60,000 + Wheat Rs. 7,500 -> Baken: Bread Rs. 1,000,000 + Flows Rs. 15,000 -> Inventory Investment (Unused Raw Materials): Rs. 22,500 -> Value of Output: Rs. 700,000 (min) 1992
Value added: Rs. 45,000 to Rs. 15,000 + Rs. 40,000 = Rs. 100,000

Investment:
CAPITAL GOODS - Long-lived goods used in production of other examples. Plant, Machinery, etc.

Note: I left the math/equations alone as per your instruction. Inventory holdings -> Inventory Expenditure, resulting in the increase in stock of capital goods of 15%. The expansion of some depreciation in value of capital goods as it is used becomes old and obsolete due to obsolescence.

- Exports are those products which are purchased by borderers.
Seas, Sakes
Torrigners.
Imports are the Goods & Services produced abroad that
are purchased by a country's residents.
Exports are added to total spending.
Produced increase country trend - $900 - $900
Imports are subtracted from total spending.

Consumers Investment and Growth purchases are

Defined to include imported goods and services.

Components of Income Approach:

* Compensation of Employees
* Proprietors' Income
* Rental income of Persons
* Corporate profits (VI)
* Net Interest
* Taxes on production and imports (vi)
* Business current transfer payments (vii)
* Current Surplus of government enterprises

Date: Income Method

- GDP measures the total income produced domestically.
- GNP (Gross National Product) measures the total income earned by nationals, which includes income from abroad.
GNP = GNP at market price + Factors Payments From Abroad - Factor Payments to Abroad

NNP (Net National Product) = GNP - Depreciation
(the amount of the economy's stock of plants, equipment, and residential structures that were used up during the year)

National Income = NNP at factor cost & Subsidies to business = business gains (or transfers)
NNP - Indirect Business Taxes

The national income is calculated by subtracting indirect taxes from the net national product.

Note: The text appears to be a summary of economic concepts, including GDP, GNP, and National Income.

Investment is putting money for real goods to help in production. (Gaathi)

Personal Income: The amount of income that households and non-corporate businesses receive.

Date: Foreign Investment - greater than 0 from foreign companies and individuals invest in India! Dividends are also included.

Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and Foreign Portfolio Investment (FPI) are two types of foreign investment. The former refers to investments made by foreign companies, while the latter refers to investments made by foreign individuals or institutions.

The concept of personal savings is also important. Personal savings can be calculated as disposable income minus consumption.

Now, let's move on to some numerical problems:

Q1: GPP (Gross Private Product) = 6000, Net Investment = 200, Gross Investment = 800
Consumption (Con) = 4000, Government Expenditure (G) = 1100, Savings (Sgort.) = 30

Find:
i) NDP (Net Domestic Product)
ii) NX (Net Exports)
iii) Taxes
iv) Disposable Income
v) Personal Savings

Q9: GDP (Gross Domestic Product) = 6000, Personal Disposable Income = 5100, Savings (Sgort.) = -200
Consumption (C) = 3800, Net Exports (NX) = -(00.T - 9T - T)

Find:
i) Investment
ii) Government Expenditure

Note: The math equations are left unchanged as per the system instruction.

Date: S(Guass + Nat) drugsday

The NDP equation is:

NDP = GPP - Depreciation
= 6000 - (8001 + 260)
= 5400

Some calculations follow:

7 = C + GI + G + NX
> 6000 = 4000 + 800 + 81100 + NX
a) + (06 4 NX = 6000 - 5300 = 100

Taxes: Sport =

Disposable Income:
DI = 6000 - 1130
= 4870

Personal Savings:
PS = DI - Consumption
= 4870 - 4000
= 870
