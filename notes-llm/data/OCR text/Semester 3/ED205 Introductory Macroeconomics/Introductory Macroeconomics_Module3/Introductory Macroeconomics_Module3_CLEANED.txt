Balance of Payments:

Saathi

The Balance of Payments (BOP) is the record of transactions of a country with the Rest of the World (R.O.W.). The BOP can be expressed as:

BOP = Current Account (CA) + Capital Account (KA) = 0.

The Current Account (CA) records trade in goods and services, as well as transfer payments. The Capital Account (KA) records purchases and sales of assets such as stocks, bonds, and land.

Pyta transactions include official reserves transactions. The BOP can also be expressed as:

BOP = CA + Pyta transactions + Official Reserves transactions = 0.

The Exchange Rate (ER) is the price of one currency in terms of another. There are two types of exchange rates:

i) Fixed ER: Foreign central banks stand ready to buy and sell their currencies at a fixed price, in terms of domestic currency.

ii) Flexible/Managed ER: This type of exchange rate allows for fluctuations in the value of the currency.

Note: The Exchange Rate is the price of one currency in terms of another.

The open economy model with flexible exchange rates and perfect capital mobility assumes that there are no capital inflows or outflows. This means that the domestic interest rate (i) is equal to the foreign interest rate (r).

In this case, the balance of payments (BOP) equation becomes:

BOP = CA + ORT

where CA represents the current account and ORT represents the official reserve transactions.

The BOP equation can be rewritten as:

BOP = 0

This implies that there is no deficit or surplus in the balance of payments.

In the case of an expansionary monetary policy (M.P.), the domestic interest rate (i) decreases, leading to an increase in aggregate demand. This increases the money supply and leads to a depreciation of the currency.

The equation of exchange can be written as:

Y = C + I + G + NX

where Y represents the nominal GDP, C represents the consumption, I represents the investment, G represents the government spending, and NX represents the net exports.

In this case, the BOP equation becomes:

BOP = CA + ORT

The BOP equation can be rewritten as:

BOP = 0

This implies that there is no deficit or surplus in the balance of payments.

The tendency of domestic abundance to depreciate and sell foreign currency (i.e. money supply) decreases, leading to a new equilibrium.

In this case, the interest rate (IM) will shift leftward, pointing at B.
