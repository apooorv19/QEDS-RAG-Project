Intelation & Unemployment: - AW Phillips, 1958

The Phillips Curve: It is an inverse relationship between the rate of unemployment and the rate of money wages.

Some simple models and an empirical model are presented. The equation is:

û = .

W. nominal wage
WA > Emp. 1 = 1
Stage of low unemployment: Drank

Wt+1 - Wt

4* - Natural rate of unemployment.
- Responsiveness of wages to unemployment.

The equation for expected inflation is passed one-for-one into actual inflation:

w = w > log w = log w - log P.

T-Te = -E(u-u*); Real Wages - Constant.

Peg(n)

The price of unemployment is sticky and vertical. The Phillips curve shows that unemployment is adaptive, meaning it takes time to adjust to changes in prices and expectations. The Peg(N) policy rule suggests that monetary policy should be used to stabilize employment and keep it close to its natural rate.

Properly implemented, this policy can help reduce the frequency and severity of economic downturns. However, if the central bank is not careful, it may create an inflationary spiral or even worse, a recession.

In conclusion, unemployment is sticky and vertical, and monetary policy should be used to stabilize employment and keep it close to its natural rate.
