MODULE 2: Input Markets of Classical Theory of Value

- Any product can be broken down to labour.
- The economic value of a good or service is determined by the total amount of socially necessary labour required to produce it.

or Neo-Classical Theory:
The economic value of a good or service is determined at the exchange price of it.

A factor/input/labor has a derived demand in the sense that its demand is generated.

Marginal Revenue (MRPL) = MRPL

1. Explanation:

Marginal Product (MP) > 0 implies that the firm should hire more labour.
(i) MP = W, implying that the firm has hired the profit-maximizing amount of labour.
(ii) MRP < 0 implies that the firm should lay off workers.

There are diminishing marginal returns to the marginal production balance falls as the assessment of labour increases. The marginal stone stems stop even though the price of the existing product is constant.

In the perfectly competitive see output market,

MRPL = E(MR)(P)(MPL) = VMPL

MRP(L) = M - MP(L) (Perfectly Competitive)

Line 1
Line 0
Line 2

The higher of the two curves represents the MRP2 curve for a firm in a competitive market. Because

There are diminishing marginal returns to labor.

The marginal product of labor falls as the

Amount of labor increases. The Material Requirements Planning (MRP) covers

Thus, slopes downward, even though the price

The output is constant.

The lower cost curve is the MRP, curve when the form has monopoly power in the output market. When forms have monopoly power, they face a downward-sloping demand curve and must therefore lower the price of all units of the product on order to sell more of it.

As a result, marginal revenue is always less than price. This explains why the monopolist's curve lies below the competitive curve and why marginal revenue falls as output increases. The marginal revenue product curve slopes downward in this case because the marginal revenue curve and the marginal product curve slope downward.

A competitive buyer will lie on demand at any given wage rate, until the point that maximizes his profit given the commodity price. That is, the firm would want to maximize the net return from labor employment for any given P&W.

Max TI = PY - WL
FOC: Pay - W = 0 => Pay = W
=> MRPL = VMPL = W

Market demand for L

It is a two-step thing:

(1) Total demand for L by all firms in one industry
(ii) Total demand for L across all industries and same as in consumer theory, i.e., horizontal summation across industries.

Elaborating on the first point,

A change in w (input price) will not lead to a P (output price) change, but output changes.
A change in w will only affect both P and Q.
Louise

For one firm,
From
- A change in w for one single firm won't change the price. This is because he is one among many other firms in perfect competition.
The industry supply curve won't shift.
- If output price changes, it dampens the input price.

Input price changes do not affect the output price. The change in output for one firm does not change the industry supply and therefore the product price also does not change.

However, when all firms in the industry respond to input price changes. There will be a change in outputs that will change the industry supply and therefore the product price.

The VMP curve will shift, and it will dampen the change in labor employment (e.g., amount of labor force), compared to when input price changes did not affect the output price.

Hence, Reaved

Industry data for L

Factor markets are similar to output markets in a sense that the factor market profit motive drives the allocation of resources.

Maximizing condition (MRP = w) is analogous to the output market profit maximizing condition. And what is to be the first MRP equation is:

MRPL = W

South all though, this can be rewritten as:

MR. MPL = W

Dividing both sides by MPL, we get:

MR = WPL
=> MR = Wx (2L)
=> MR = w(24/2L)

Hence, proved.

Moreover, it is also true that:

o° MR = MC

Supply of Input Markets

In a perfectly competitive input market, each firm that supplies labor is like a price taker, who operates at the fixed market price of labor, determined by the market demand.

For Firm
P = ME = AE

P = MRR

P = MRR

P = MRR

P = MRR

P = ME = AE

P = MRR

P = MRR

P = MRR

P = ME = AE

0

Average Expenditure (AE) in input market is analogous to AR in output market under perfect competition.
Price per unit that the firm pays for a commodity.
Of Marginal Expenditure (ME) = 2(PIQI)
is the additional cost of purchasing one additional unit of output.

The determination of how much labor a firm should hire in a competitive market relies on the principle of equating the incremental benefit gained from having one more unit of labor with the extra expenditure incurred.

By employing that additional unit of time

By finding the point at which MRP equals W, or Marginal Revenue Product, and ME, or Marginal Expense, the firm optimizes its labor procurement. In imperfect competition, this condition is also for profit maximization.

AVERAGE EXPENDITURE (AE) in an infact market is analogous to what it would be under perfect competition. Heise per asist the figure pays for a commodity.

HARSH EXPERIENCE (ME) = 2 (Persons), which represents the additional cost of founding one additional worker.

# Market Supply for Labour

The market supply curve is usually upward sloping. However, for any other input its supply is determined by the profit maximising choice, i.e., (w = MR) under perfect competition.

However, when the input is labour in addition to this profit maximising decision the labourer is also driven by his utility maximising choice. And this situation we come across a backward-bending labour supply curve!

A labourer derives utility from work & leisure. So he divides his resources, or time, between hours of work and hours of leisure. If he works for one more unit of time he gets 'w', so the opportunity cost of leisure is 'w'.

Labourer substitutes his work hours with less leisure. Thus, leisure becomes costlier relative to work, while utility remains constant.

We look at the change of real income. So when 'w' increases, the leisure demand also increases, i.e., utility changes.

Equilibrium in the Competitive Labour Market

A competitive input market is said to be in equilibrium when the price of the input equates quantity demanded and quantity supplied of the input. At this point, WE equals DL = MRPL.

This equilibrium is obtained at point E.

If the output market for the product that uses this input is perfectly competitive, then the demand curve for the input has an additional meaning. It measures the additional benefit the consumer derives when one more unit of the input is used, i.e., ΔP = VMP.

When both output and input markets are perfectly competitive, efficient utilisation of the input requires

MRP = P*M.P.
If the output market is imperfectly competitive, then MRP equals P*MPL.
The price of the product 'P' measures the

Value that the consumer gives to every additional unit of a good or service, measured by the willingness and ability to pay for it.

Unit of output is purchasing, which

ECONOMIC RENT

In the factor market, economic rent is the difference between payments made to a factor of production and the numerical amount that has to be paid to be able to consume that factor.

The supply curve tells us how much of labor will be supplied at each wage. So the numerical expenditure required of units of labor is given by the total area under the supply curve, given by DAEL".

When there's perfect information, under perfectly competitive input market, among the workers. Each worker is paid a wage w*, so the total wage payment is given by OW*EL*.

So, the economic rent as per the definition is given by the area AW*E.

In case of a perfectly elastic labor supply curve, economic rent is zero. In case of a perfectly inelastic labor supply curve, all payments to the factor are economic rent. This is because that amount of labor will be supplied irrespective of what was paid. For example, land (housing).

AND BUT

1. The supply owner table shows how much labor will be supplied at each wage. So, the minimum expenditure on the complete extent of solvency in given by the total over wider than the willingness to come, as given by OAEL.

Euler's Proof

Euler proved that the Production Efficiency Theorem (PET) holds when the production function f(K, L) is linearly homogeneous.

OC. Y = OF(L) + OF(K)
is all too obvious
hopefully so, Miss
=> 0: Y = M(P)L + MP(K)K
1: linearly homogeneous.
P. Y = P(MPL)L + P(MPK)K
J60 = K9
=> P.Y = W(L) + r(K).
The PET can be interpreted as an equation in a perfectly competitive market where separate firms are paralleling each other, and the future strongs add up to write.
