MODULE 4: Social Welfare Functions

Social Welfare Function is a function that measures the welfare of a society as a whole, considering the utilities obtained by all the members of the society.

Equal weightage is given to everyone's utility.

and then, the total utility of society is maximized.

(ii) Market-oriented: This ensures equity in the sense that the outcome of the competitive free market

Ensures mainization of utility for every individual in the society. As they are driven by the "invisible hand". Basically, the free market ensures that everyone gets what they deserve.

(iii) Rawlstan: The most equitable allocation is such that it maximizes the utility of the least well-off person in the economy.

(%) Egalitarian: It involves an equal allocation of all resources and goods among all members of society.

SECOND THEOREM OF WELFARE ECONOMICS

A perfectly competitive Pareto-efficient allocation may or may not be equitable. Usually, efficient allocations lose out on equity, and this is where government intervention is required to mitigate the efficiency vs. equity dilemma. For example, a progressive tax structure.

If individual preferences are convex, then every Pareto-efficient allocation between two consumers of two goods is a competitive equilibrium for some initial allocation of goods.

It tries to solve the trade-off between efficiency and equity. A competitive equilibrium that is more equitable can be achieved by redistributing resources among individuals or groups, without leading to a loss of efficiency. Any redistribution policy has its own cost.

The Welfare economics framework, built on the fundamentals of the First and Second Welfare Theorems, is a primary tool used to solve the equity versus efficiency dilemma in public policy creation and intervention.

To witigate the efficiency versus opportunity dilemma, an example is a progressive tax structure. If individual proposals are converted, then every forest efficient allocation of the two goods is a competitive equilibrium, regardless of some slight abatement of goods.

Efficiency in Production

Till now, we had fixed total supplies of the two goods (endowments) out of which consumers were to obtain a Pareto efficient allocation.

We now look at how these two goods are produced in an efficient manner through efficient allocation of factor inputs.

2 Goods
-> INPUT MARKET: Factor supply earning
2 Inputs
- GOODS MARKET: Spending income

Many consumers, with a dual role, purchasing goods and getting utility. This framework links the demand-supply elements in different markets. An individual who is supplying labor or capital input to be used to produce a commodity uses the factor income thereby earned to demand that commodity in the product market. So, the same individual who is a factor supplier in the input market is a consumer in the goods market.

To any policy-driven change in one area will generate willower feedback effects, occurring across sectors/markets. It is only in the GE framework that such

# Technical Efficiency

A particular allocation of inputs is being used in a production process to produce two goods, G1 and G2.

Is said to be technologically efficient, if deviation from

That input combination leads to an increase in output.

One good can be achieved only by lowering the output of the other.

The cost minimizing input choice to produce G1 is given by,
MPL = WA.
MRTS LIKE =
MPK
Similarly, we have the cost minimizing input choice to produce GIZ given by,
MRTSL, K = -MPL * W/MPK
The MPK occurs where,
(1) successive isoquants of two goods are tangent to each other at out the sufficient is other to
(i) each esocost is tangent to each isoquant.
Labour and Capital earn the same wage and the same rate of return on capital in both sectors. This is possible under two conditions:
(i) Perfect competition: free entry and exit, and
(ii) perfect mobility and homogeneity of factors over the margin rate of transformation between two goods, i.e., how many units of Y (new good) are needed to produce one more unit of X (rain).

# Production Possibility Frontier

The PPF is a locus of combinations of output levels of maximum production that are produced through full utilization of resources for any given technology.

→ Point C is inefficient due to under-utilization of resources.
→ Point A is not feasible.

Technological improvement shifts out the PPF.
→ Point E is efficient due to maximum production.

Slope of PPF = MCX - MRX
* MRT (marginal rate of transformation) gives us the marginal rate of transformation between the two goods, i.e., how many units of Y-axis good have to be given up to produce one more unit of X-axis good. It increases as we move down along the PPF.

PPF is negatively sloped to expand the production in one sector, output of the other sector has to contract. This is because initially both labour and capital were fully utilised. Only when you contract one sector, the released input can be used to increase production in the other sector.

PPF is concave to the origin/bulging out. This is because as we move down along the PPF, the per unit cost of producing an additional unit of 67's increases, and that of 61's falls. Thereby, raising the marginal cost (MCx) and thus the marginal rate of transformation (MRT).

The underlying reason is the diminishing marginal productivities of the inputs. As more input is used to raise output of the X-axis good (G2), marginal physical product of labour (MPL) and marginal physical product of capital (MPK) start falling in the X-axis good sector. So, the yield per unit production west in this sector keeps rising.

The story of efficiency explains why MCY-and is similar. As we move down along the production possibility frontier (PPF), output levels should match demand in market.

(i) Marginal Revenue Product of Labor (MRTS) equals the marginal revenue product of labor (W/r) = MRTS of labor and capital (L, K)

(ii) Output levels should match demand in market.

* The marginal rate of technical substitution (MRT)<sub>1,2</sub> is equal to the marginal rate of substitution (MRS)<sub>1,2</sub>.

MID
The two conditions are ensured where MRT equals MRS.

To the Mrs. measures the consumer's willingness to pay (OD).

Pay for the additional unit of X-axis, good or not.

How much is he willing to give up for what he wants?

To get and one more unit of X anis good. MRS gives the valuation of the two goods to the consumer.

Consumer

MRT measures the valuation of the two goods to

Producer, that is measured in terms of the

Cost of producing an additional unit of X-axis good in terms of cost of giving up a Y-axis good.

There is an excess demand for the X-axis good and an excess supply for the Y-axis good. This will cause the producer to produce more of the X-axis good, thereby increasing the nation's MCX-anis. Thereby, increasing the nation's MCy-anis.

Superimposing the IC (Indifference Curve) & the PPF (Production Possibility Frontier), the point of tangency between them ensures output efficiency, i.e., MRT = MRS.

Although all points on the PPF are technologically efficient, it does not ensure that technologically efficient production levels of the two goods match the demand for the two goods from the consumer side.

(D) It is only at the tangency it is ensured.

As a social planner/government, it is difficult to achieve output efficiency, since different consumers have different preferences between the goods they have different preferences below the goods therefore different MRS values.

(II) So how to decide how much of the two goods to be produced and how much will be allocated to the consumers?

Consumers?

This is the reason why centrally planned communism

Economies failed, and led the way to success.

"Driven by the invisible hand, a.k.a. Pouce mechanism."

Under perfectly competitive structures, every consumer well separates where MRS<sub>1,2</sub> = -P<sub>1</sub>. Simultaneously, the perfectly competitive producer will operate where P_x = MC_x & P_x = MC_y.

MRT = MC_x = P_x = MU_x = MRS + MC_y = P_y * MU_y

excess demand tangency does not occur, "efficient production" and efficient consumption points are separate.

Suppose this occurs. Then,
At Point A,
(e) MRT = P_F/P_c
(9) MRS = P_F/P_C.
At point C,
(i) MRT = P_F/P_c
(10) MRS = P_F.

Overall Efficiency Conditions in GE

(1) Efficiency in Exchange: MRS_1,2 = MRS_1,2

All allocations must lie on the contract curve, ensuring the above. Competitive market conditions ensure Pareto efficiency, such that,

MRTSL,K = MRTSL,K
Perfectly competitive input market ensures input choice such that,
MRTSLIK = W = MRTSLIK
(iii) Efficiency in output market
Output combination of the two goods should be such that,
MRT = MRS (for all consumers)

A perfectly competitive market ensures on the production side, Py-anis = MC x-anis and Py-anis = MC y-anis. On the consumer side, Px-anis = MV x-anis = MRS and Py-anis MU y-anis. Therefore, overall efficiency implies that MRT = MCx-anis/MCy-anis = Px-anis/Py-anis = MUX-anis/MUY-anis = MRS.
