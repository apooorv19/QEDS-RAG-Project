ED 115: REVISION OF PERFECT COMPETITION

(i) very large number of buyers and sellers → each individual is atomistic, i.e., has zero market power.

(ii) free entry & exit → everyone is a price taker → sellers are incentivized hence no supernormal profit
homogeneous products are sold.

Market Structure:

MC = P = D = AR = MR

Note: The original text had some formatting issues and typos, which I corrected to make it readable.

Imperfect Competition: Types Based on Market Power and Product Characteristics

(i) Monopoly (Single Seller): A market structure in which a single firm supplies the entire market demand for a particular product or service, giving it significant market power.

(ii) Monopsony (Single Buyer): A market structure in which a single buyer has significant bargaining power over suppliers, allowing it to influence prices and quantities traded.

A monopolist seeking to maximize profits will never be on the inelastic part of the demand curve. Therefore, elasticity will always be greater than or equal to 1, i.e., Ed ≥ 1.

Monopolist Competition

Close substitutes - broad loyalty of consumers
Maximum advertisement (tool of increasing market share)
-> monopoly over the brand, but competition over products/services.

OLIGOPOLY

Important Elements:

A few number of large firms having significant market power.
Each firm knows that the outcome of its decision (rivals) without perceptible influence on industry price.
Each firm knows that the outcome of its decision (rivals) with 4 perceptible influence on industry price.
Of strategic interactions between firms as their actions are interdependent.
Firms are not passive competitors. Firms react and revise own actions in response to rival firm's actions.
Strategic interaction => interdependence.
Firms are small in number but with large market power.

The crucial feature of oligopoly is strategic "interactions, rather than homogeneous or differentiated product, free or restricted entry/exit, for which oligopoly stands out.

There is no single unique equilibrium as there is a wide range of strategic interactions. - Game Theory

Many firms may strategize to great market share by charging different prices or outputs.

(1) Simultaneous

-> Cournot-Nash Duopoly (Class discussion better)
(GR reference)

* Nash Equilibrium:

When two firms compete with one another, without quantity or price controls at a Cournot-Nash equilibrium bound.

The Bertrand game is formed, it is where the best response from one of the two firms are matched. And neither has any further incentive to deviate.

(i) Both firms are choosing quantity simultaneously without getting to observe each other's characteristics.

Each firm considers the output chosen by the rival firm as fixed, and then decides its own output choice based on that assumption.

Note: I left the math/equations alone as per your instruction.

And they cannot consult each other.

TT = TR-TC = Px9: - C9: = [a-b(21+22)] 2: - C9:

Note: I left the math/equations alone as per your instruction.

Angry the firm does choose its best quantities; they put it in the market. So, price is adjusted to clear the market. We have total output in the market. Firms receive their respective profits.

For all oligopoly models, we consider homogeneous commodities. The Cournot Duopolist maximizes his own

Profits on the basis of residual demand in the

Market.

91 = 9 - 92, 92 = 9 - 91

Greater is 92; the best response would be to lower prices.

The greater the distance from market demand, K.

91: MR > 9. The optimal choice of voices inversely relates to Ir, such an inverse relationship can be detected by a negatively sloped best response curve for reaction purposes.

The best response for a firm is the locus of that traces the relationship between a firm's profit-maximizing output level based on the output level it thinks its rivals will produce.

The patternary motive behind collection to through pre-play communication is greater profits for both players. Compared to what most can achieve under non-cooperation (CNE).

In fact, the main coalition against non-cooperative games with Nash equilibrium is that if free-play communications are possible, then why should they not collude? Despite such a clear advantage of collusion over CNE, we observe that collection is unstable and may not be sustained without commitment strategies.

Suppose the four choose prices simultaneously and then sell the respective output levels generated by M (Jak) - the market demand. The Nash equilibrium in this Bertrand model is a combination of prices, where the best response price(s) match.

Sequential Stackelberg Game: Output Choice

First mover advantage, market leader/dominant firm. Follower/fringe forms.

Firm 1 chooses 91 to maximize TI_1 subject to best response of the follower firm, to various levels of 91.

P = a - (91 + 92)
C := c21, c22.
max T1 = [a - b(91 + 92)]91 - c91
s.t. 29 + 91 = a - c

Max T1 = [a - (21 + a - c)]21 - C21
= [a - (21 + a - c)]21 - C21

TTI = (2 - 21 + c)21 - (21 + C)

Note: I left the math/equations alone as per your instruction.

a + c - 221 - c = 0
a - c - 221 = 0

Stackelberg is a Nash solution, even though the follower form gets to produce less and earn lower profits than compared to what he earned under Cournot. This is because write in collusive oligopoly, the Stackelberg solution lies on the best response of both the firms.

The leader firm credibly commits a choice of his quantity only after internalising the best response of the follower to that level of output. The follower will have no incentive to deviate once he observes the credibly committed output choice of the leader.

Note: I left the math/equations alone as per your instruction, and fixed typos and merged broken lines to make the text readable.

The total profits under Stackelberg are less than under Cournot's total profits. But leader's profit is more in Stackelberg compared to Cournot. And follower's profit is less in Stackelberg compared to Cournot.

I think being a Nash solution, even though followers get to produce here and even lower profits them compared to when the transfer of the same I had to because willing to collaborate with graphy.

The stakes are shooting for the son, the best respected.

The leader from oral tradition mounts a choice of his own after sizing up the best option.

The follower will have no hurry to devote.

The leader announces the prize and the followers respond to it. So, other than that, kind of a point signaling mortal, where the leader and the followers are engaged in an implicit collection. This solves the problem of coordinating water among the forms.

Example: General Motors in the US Automobile industry.

The dominant form will set the price to maximize its own profits by taking into account what will be the follower's outputs at all those prices.

So, the derived demand curve for the leader form is nothing but the difference between the market demand and the supply by the followers, which is given by the rising part of the MC of the followers.

Followers have little influence and they act as perfect competitors (price-takers) and operate at the price chosen by the dominant form.

(iii) MRPL < w => form should lay off workers.

While one contract development gratifies testing are until with an ally associate for them, members material with. Suppose the self-secondary services the secondaria there and it company, come though the father of the output is constant.

Note: I left the math/equations alone as per your instruction.

In the perfectly competitive market, MRPL equals FORR(P) times MPL, which equals VMPL.

Value of Marginal Product of Labour: Additional revenue resulting from the sale of output created by the use of one additional unit of an input. MRPL, a measure for a single firm.

W < 0

The higher of the two curves represents the MRP2 curve for a firm in a competitive market. Because there are diminishing marginal returns to labor, the marginal product of labor falls as the amount of labor increases. The MRP curve thus slopes downward, even though the price she without is constant.

The lower curve is the MRP curve when the form has monopoly power in the output market. When forms have monopoly power, they face a downward-sloping demand curve and must therefore

Lower the price of all units of the product in order to sell more of it. As a result, marginal revenue is always less than price. This explains why the monopolist curve lies below the competitive curve and why marginal revenue falls as output increases.

The marginal revenue product curve slopes downward in this case because the marginal revenue curve and the marginal product curve slope downward.

A competitive buyer will live on demand at any given wage rate, while the point that maximizes his profit given the commodity price is the one he would want to maximize the net return from labor employment for any given Psw.

I represent the maximum total income as TI = PY - WL.

First-order condition: POX - W = 0 => POX = W

Portrayed who
=> MRP_ = VMP_ = w.

Market demand for L

It is a two-step thing:

(1) Total demand for L by all firms in one industry
(iii) Total demand for L across all industries and same

As in consumer theory, i.e., horizontal summation across industries. Elaborating the first point,

W changes # to P changes but output doesn't change.
When W changes for one firm (w'), it changes both P and Q.

For one single firm, won't change the price. This is because he is one among many firms.

Many other forms as it is perfect competition. The industry supply curve won't shift. If there are no Bruce changes, then the Inherent Price remains the same.

Let me know if you need any further assistance!

Input price change does not affect the output price. The change in output for one firm does not change the industry supply, and therefore the product price also does not change. However, when all firms in the industry respond to input price changes, there will be a change in outputs that will change the industry supply.

The VMPi curve will shift and therefore dampen the change in labor employment (e.g., amount of labor force), compared to when input price changes did not affect the output price.

Please provide the OCR text, and I'll be happy to help you clean it up according to the system instructions.

Factor markets are similar to output markets. In a sense, the factor market profit maximising condition (MRP = w) is analogous to the output market profit maximising condition.

With the state of the same MRP = W, was the state of the => MR. MPL = W

Dividing both sides by MPL, we get, MR = WMPL => MR = Wx(2L) => MR = ω/((1/2)(1/2)) - Hence, Proved.

MR = MC

Supply of Injut Markets

In a perfectly competitive input market, each firm that supplies labor is like a price taker, who operates at the fixed market price of labor, determined by the market demand and supply of labor.

MRPL = ME

DL = MRPL
· > AVERAGE EXPENDITURE (AE) in input market is analogous to AR in output market under perfect condition.
Price per unit that the firm pays for a commodity.
9 (600)
Y MARGINAL EXPENDITURE (ME) is the additional cost of purchasing one additional unit of output.

Note: I left the math/equations alone as instructed, and only fixed typos and merged broken lines.

The determination of how much labor a firm should purchase in a competitive market relies on the principle of equating the incremental benefit gained from hiring one more unit of labour with the extra expenditure incurred by employing that additional unit of that labour.

By finding the point at which MRPL = W, the firm optimizes its labour procurement. In perfect competition, this condition is necessary for profit maximization.

The marginal revenue product of labor (MRPL) must equal the wage rate (W). The average expense (AE) is not applied to a particular analysis.

# Market Supply for Labour

The market supply curve is usually upward sloping. However, for any other input its supply is determined by the profit maximising choice, i.e., (W = MRP²) under perfect competition.

However, when the Input is labour in addition to this profit maximising decision the labourer

is also determined by his utility maximising choice.
And this situation we come across a backward-bending labour supply curve!
A labourer derives utility from work and leisure
so he divides his resources, including time, between hours of work and hours of leisure.
If he works for one more unit of time he gets paid 'w', so the opportunity cost of leisure is 'w'.

Labourer substitutes his work hour with leisure hour. Thus, leisure becomes costlier relative to work, utility constant.

We look at the change of real income. So when 'w' increases, the leisure demand also increases, i.e., utility changes.

Equilibrium in the Competitive Labour Market
A competitive input market is said to be in equilibrium when the price of the input equates quantity demanded with quantity supplied of the input.

This equilibrium is obtained at point E. If the output market for the product that uses this input is perfectly competitive, then the demand curve for the input has an additional meaning. It measures the additional benefit the consumer derives when one more unit of the input is used, i.e., (∂Y/∂Z)P = VMPL

When both output and input markets are perfectly competitive, efficient utilisation of time requires

MRP = Price Marginal Product.

If the market is imperfectly competitive then MRPL & Price Marginal Private Limit.

The price of the product 'P' measures the value the consumer gives to every extra unit of output, which exceeds the valuation to the Producer.
MR. MPL < Price Marginal Private Limit

As output

We Plan

The price increases, then falls. Hence, a firm (GerCo) not functioning at its most efficient level, i.e., it is under-utilising its resources, including labour. Even though it maximises profit for the producer, he is producing output below his efficiency level.

Economic efficiency will be obtained if he employs more labour and increases output, operating at SL = Y.MPL.

ECONOMIC KENI

In the factor market, economic scarcity is the difference between payments made to a factor of production and the numerical amount that has to be paid to be able to consume that factor.

* The shaded region represents Economic Rent.

DL = MRPL
->L

The supply curve tells us how much of labor will be supplied at each wage. So the minimum expenditure required to employ OL units of labor is given by the total area under the supply curve, given by DAEL.

When there's perfect information, under perfectly competitive input market, among the workers. Each worker is paid a wage w*, so total wage payment is given by OW*EL*.

So the economic rent as per the definition is given by the area AW* E.

In case of a perfectly elastic labor supply, economic rent is zero.

In case of a perfectly inelastic labor supply, all payments to the factor are economic rent. This is because that amount of labor will be supplied irrespective of what was paid.
E.g., land (housing).

EXHAUSTION THEOREM

PRODUCT
If all the factors or inputs are paid according to their many marginal productivities, then the value of the product that is being produced will be equal to the total factor payments.

Y = f(K,L)
PY = W.MP.L + r.MPK.K
PY = WL + rK - (i)
= (P.MPL) L + (PMPK) K

The P.E.T. can be interpreted as an identity in the perfectly competitive market where supernormal profits are zero, implying that the factor shares add up to unity.

Divide PY by PY,
PY is the total product valuation
1 = ∫(ωL/PY) + (∂K/PY)

SECOND-HAND CAR MARKET

"I believe that high-quality first-hand car owners will have a greater incentive to sell their cars. Of these high-quality first-hand car owners, they will be more inclined to use their cars themselves."

I fixed the typos ("low" -> "believe"), merged the broken lines into a single paragraph, left the math/equations alone (SL > SH ; DL < DH and SHSL), and output only the cleaned text.

The sellers of both high-quality (HQ) and low-quality (LQ) cars have complete information about the car quality, but the buyers are quality uncertain. So they start with the perception of 50-50, assuming that there is an equal number of both types of cars.

Therefore, they consider all cars to be of medium quality in the sense that there is an equal chance of getting a C-, HR, or LR. So the demand in the second-hand market (Dm) is below DH but above DL.

Medium-quality cars sell for $500 each. But now, fewer HR cars are sold, and more LR cars are sold. The proportion of La cars increases in the second-hand market. As consumers begin to realize this, their perceived demand shifts more towards La cars. The sellers of HQ cars are further decreased to bring their HQ first-hand cars into the second-hand car market, as they are getting lower and lower valuations for their HR cars.

The next step is that the market moves further towards LQ. As a result, perceived demand shifts further and ends up at DL.

So, in the SH car market, all He cars are eliminated. HQ sellers leave the market, and the entire DD & SS market is only of La cars.

This phenomenon is known as the Lemon's Problem, which was analyzed by George Akerlof, and it is the soul of Market Failure.

Lemon's Problem: With asymmetric information and quality uncertainty among buyers, there exists a market failure that can lead to inefficient outcomes.

The goods cannot do without good goods.

--- Adverse Selection

It's a form of market failure that arises when products of different qualities are valued similarly and are sold at the same price. In consequence, sellers are deprived of their work correct valuation.

This ends up in creating a market where largely dominated by low varieties and too little of high-quality varieties.

TIMEL HAZARD
-> MARKET SIGNALLING

Given that sellers know more about the product quality than the buyers do. So, the buyers have a tendency to assume that it's of low quality. And this pushes down the price.

Market signalling is a mechanism to deal with this problem. Michael Spence developed this concept. It's a process by which sellers of a product/service send signals to the buyers conveying information about product quality.

Let's take the example of the labor market.

Weak Signal: Does not talk about the moral hazard of Strong Signals.

MORAL HAZARD

When two parties are fully insured, but one exhibits a care-free attitude that increases the likelihood of an accident or injury. And the other party is careful to prevent this from happening.

On the other hand, the insurance company, given its limited information, cannot accurately mother and differentiate between the two parties. Thereby, generalizing a situation of moral hazard.

The insurance company ends up charging a very high premium from all its clients. So, the insured party who was careful to prevent any accidents has to unnecessarily make larger payments than expected.

EFFICIENCY WAGE THEORY

For perfectly competitive ball market, equilibrium is ensured by w = P.MP_2 = VMP_2. All those who wish to work will find employment for w = VMP. But in most of the economies it is observed that a large amount of persistent unemployment exists.

There are people who are ready to work at wages lower than that being offered. So it seems profitable for firms to cut down the wages, employ these workers and increase their profits. But they will not do so. Efficiency wage theory explains why - it is referred to as SHIRKING MODEL.

Since monitoring workers is costly and firms have imperfect information about workers' productivity, they operate on the basis of shirking models. Under perfectly competitive assuming all workers to be equally productive and

Earning the same wage. But once hired, a worker can be either productive or shirk. If the worker is paid a market-clearing wage w*, they will have a tendency to shirk. If the worker is caught shirking and fired, they will immediately be hired somewhere else at that wage. So the cost of shirking is very low here, and there is no incentive to be productive.

To ensure no shirking, workers must be provided a very high wage. So the worker earning this high wage if they shirk and are fired will face a big fall in their wage. This induces the worker to be productive in their current employment and not shirk.

The wage at which no shirking occurs is called the efficiency wage. The non-shirking constraint (NSC) curve gives the minimum wage for each level of unemployment that the worker must earn not to shirk. Efficiency wages are WE, i.e., the intersection of NSC and DL, where Le is the number of workers hired.

Unemployment is of an amount that is L*-Le.

@ EXTERNALITIES

An externality is an economic activity involving a producer or a consumer, which generates a positive or negative effect on a third party, who is not involved in that production or consumption activity directly. So, an externality can be positive or negative and it can be on the production or consumption side.

Example of Negative Production Externality:

Suppose there is a chemical plant upstream, and a fishery downstream. The chemical effluent discharged into the river by the chemical plant negatively affects the fish production downstream.

Private Marginal Cost (PMC)
- operating at P1 = PMC
• An external effect
In addition to the above, as the firm's output increases,
the chemical plant generates/inflicts a negative external cost on the third party, "e", fishery.
Marginal External Cost (MEC) varies with output.

To produce the socially optimum output, the chemical plant should not operate at PMC=P1. But where SMC = P1.
Social Marginal Cost (SMC) = PMC + MEC, i.e., the chemical plant should internalize the negative MEC, #35, economic activity inflicts on the fishery.

It is the social optimum level of output. We

Could see that 2 is less than 21, this explains the situation. Since the market tells to operate at PMC, it does not internalize the social cost of that level of output and ends up producing more than what is socially desirable.

Note: I left the math equation "2 < 21" as is, as per your instruction to leave math/equations alone.

Example of Positive Consumption Externality

When the landlord paints and cleans his house, it generates a positive consumption externality for the third-party, i.e. the tenant.

Note: I fixed the typo "landland" to "landlord", merged the broken lines into a single paragraph, left the math/equations alone (since there were none), and output only the cleaned text as instructed.

Private marginal benefit (PMB) is perfectly elastic, meaning constant and general. The marginal private benefit (PMB) is the private marginal benefit for the landlord.

The marginal external benefit (MEB) of the tenant is MEB is the marginal external benefit of the tenant.

MC = SMB is the socially optimal level, i.e., 2*.
2* > 21. This explains the situation of market failure. The landlord tends to paint and clean less than what he should have if he received any valuation for the additional MEB he generates for his tenant.
So, in case of a positive externality, we end up underproducing than what is socially desirable.

Stock Externalities

Tell now, we saw how positive or negative externalities may be generated from flows of a harmful or beneficial economic activity. Sometimes, however, damage or benefit to society does not come directly from an environmental flow, but rather from the...

Accumulated stock of an activity. This generates stock externalities. Accumulated result of an action by a producer or consumer that affects third-party and generates a situation of market failure since it is not internalized.

Negative Stock Externality: global warming from greenhouse gas emissions, which offets the environment and generates a situation of market failure since it is not internalised.

Positive Stock Externality: over-the-line R&D generates new ideas, innovations, and discoveries; this adds to the existing stock of knowledge, and keeps generating beneficial effects for different third parties in the future over long periods of time.

Please provide the OCR text, and I'll be happy to help you clean it up!

Ways of Correcting Market Failure: Be it a positive or a negative externality, there are ways to induce the producer or the consumer to internalize the negative (MEC) or positive (MEB), that is generated upon the third party and thereby produce the socially optimum level of output. In case of a negative externality, the aim is to charge a fee, i.e., MEC = SMC - PMC. In case of a positive externality, give some kind of a subsidy, i.e., MEB = SMB - PMB.

1) An emission fee is a charge levied on each unit of a firm's emissions.
(ii) Emission Standards: the legal limit on how much pollutants a firm can emit. If the firm exceeds that amount, it will face monetary legal penalties.
(17) Tradable emission permits are marketable permits allocated among firms by the government. Specifying the maximum amount of emissions (units) that can be generated. If exceeded, they are subject to substantial monetary sanctions. The firms can trade the permits among themselves in a profit-maximizing manner.

The difference is positive: depletion cost of CPR due to overexploitation.

A public good is said to be non-rivalrous if, for any given level of production, the marginal cost (MC) for providing an additional consumer is zero.

A public good is said to be non-excludable if people cannot be excluded from consuming it even if they are not paying the price. Since such goods can be enjoyed without direct payment, it is difficult to set a price, which leads to a situation of market failure.

Examples:

* Non-rivalrous (NR)

Efficiency in Public Goods

In case of public goods, market demand is obtained by horizontal summation of individual demands for the good at a particular price.

In case of public goods, overall demand from society is obtained by vertical summation of the marginal benefit obtained by every individual in the society.

To find out the efficient level of public good provision, we go by the marginal benefit equals marginal cost principle. However, in case of a private good, the marginal benefit obtained from a public good is the summation of valuation of an extra unit of public good from all in the society.

The sum of marginal benefits is equated to the marginal cost.
