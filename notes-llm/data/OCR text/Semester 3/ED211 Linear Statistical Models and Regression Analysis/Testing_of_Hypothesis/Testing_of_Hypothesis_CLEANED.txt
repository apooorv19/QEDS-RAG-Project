What we do in hypothesis testing?

Hypothesis testing is a statistical method used to test an assumption or claim (hypothesis) about a population parameter based on a sample statistic.

For example, one might be interested in testing:

Whether the average weight of products in an assembly line is the same as the standard (or permissible) weight.
Whether the average productivity of employees post-training increased compared to that of pre-training.
Whether the gender of employees and the level of leadership roles assigned to them are independent or dependent.
Whether the mean stock prices of pharmaceutical companies increased after the COVID-19 lockdown compared to that of pre-COVID time.

General Steps of Hypothesis Testing

STEP-1: Frame two hypotheses, null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis based on the given problem.

Null hypothesis:
It is a statement regarding the population parameter that assumes no bias or no difference.
Null hypothesis must contain '=' sign (equality sign).
It is denoted by H0.

Alternative hypothesis:
It is always opposite and complementary to the null hypothesis.
Alternative hypothesis must not contain '=' sign (equality sign).
It is denoted by H1 or H2.

How to Frame Null and Alternative Hypotheses?

Suppose you need to test the claim: the average prices of a stock is 2500.

Hypothesis testing:

Ex1: The null hypothesis is that the population mean price is equal to 2500 (μ = 2500), and the alternative hypothesis is that the population mean price is not equal to 2500 (μ ≠ 2500).

Ex2: The null hypothesis is that the population mean price is less than or equal to 2500 (μ ≤ 2500), and the alternative hypothesis is that the population mean price is greater than 2500 (μ > 2500).

Suppose you need to test the claim: the average prices of a stock are less than or equal to $2500.

The null hypothesis, H0, states that the population mean price is less than or equal to $2500 (μ ≤ 2500).

The alternative hypothesis, H1, states that the population mean price is greater than $2500 (μ > 2500).

Step-2: Identify whether the test is one-tailed or two-tailed test.
This is decided on the basis of the alternative hypothesis.

The alternative hypothesis determines whether the test is one-tailed or two-tailed.

Step-3: Fix the level of significance (α)
usually it is fixed at 0.05 or 0.01.

What is the level of significance (α)?

It is the probability of rejecting a null hypothesis based on a sample, when the null hypothesis is actually true for the population (i.e., committing Type-I error). Alpha needs to be kept at a minimum level, usually at 0.05 or 0.01.

Reject H0: <b>Do not</b> reject H0 if H0 is true (e.g., mean marks are actually 25). If H0 is false, Type -I Error (2) or Type -II.

Actually, mean marks are not equal to 25.

Step-4: Choose an appropriate test statistic and carry out the test.

For example,

1. Testing a population mean (unknown standard deviation)

* t-test for single sample
	+ Hypothesis: The mean income of a population is Rs. 10000.
	+ Unknown standard deviation.

2. Comparing two independent samples

* Test that the average income of workers from firm A and firm B are same.
* Means based on two independent samples (unknown population standard deviations).
* t-test for comparing two means.

Step-5: Calculate the value of the test statistic (such as Z, t, F values) and then compare that with the tabulated value (also called critical value) for a given level of significance α.

Step-6: Conclude based on the following rule:

Decision/conclusion
situation

For right-tailed tests, if the calculated test statistic exceeds the critical value, we reject the null hypothesis.

Reject the null hypothesis if the calculated statistic is greater than that of the critical value and accept the alternative hypothesis at an alpha level of significance.

• For a left-tailed test, if the calculated value is lesser than the critical value, reject the null hypothesis at the alpha level of significance.
• For a two-tailed test, if the calculated test statistic is greater than the right-tailed critical value or less than the left-tailed critical value, reject the null hypothesis at an alpha level of significance.

Otherwise, do not reject the null hypothesis at an alpha level of significance.

The critical value approach is a decision rule that guides in rejecting or not rejecting the null hypothesis.

The critical value is a point that separates the rejection region from the acceptance region, indicating the boundary between the two.

From the non-rejection (acceptance) region. It is to see if the observed test statistic value (say Z or t) lies at the extreme of the given cut-off values (critical values) for a particular level of significance (alpha).

Single Sample Tests
1. T-test for Testing a Single Mean

t-test for Population Mean (Single Sample)

Assumptions:
The parent population from which the sample is drawn is normally distributed.
The population standard deviation σ is unknown.

The sample size may be small, n less than 30.

t equals fraction of X minus M over S divided by m. This follows t-distribution with (n-1) degrees of freedom.

Test statistic formula: Where S is sample standard deviation, S equals square root of 2 times (xi minus x-bar) squared all divided by xi minus 1.

Q-1: The McFarland Insurance Company Claims Department reports the mean cost to process a claim is $60. An industry comparison showed this amount to be larger than most other insurance companies, so the company instituted cost-cutting measures. To evaluate the effect of the cost-cutting measures, the supervisor of the Claims Department selected a random sample of 26 claims processed last month and recorded the cost to process each claim. The sample information is reported below.

$45
$49
$61
$62

At the 0.01 significance level, is it reasonable to conclude that the mean cost to process a claim is now less than $60?

Q-2:
A random sample of size 20 is taken, resulting in a sample mean of 16.45 and a sample standard deviation of 3.59. Assume x is normally distributed and use this information and α = .05 to test the following hypotheses.

H0: μ = 16
Ha: μ ≠ 16
