Introduction to Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)
In many situations we may have conduct a hypothesis test to compare mean
values simultaneously for more than two groups (samples) created using a
factor (or factors).
For example, a marketer may like to understand the impact of three different
discount values (such as 0%, 10%, and 20% discount) on the average sales.
• The marketing manager would like to understand whether the variable 'price
discount' has any significant impact on the average sales quantity.
Such studies are called single factor experimental studies.

Introduction to Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)
Different discount rates correspond to different levels of the factor
(different levels of price discount)
The different discount levels (such as 0%, 10% and 20%) are assigned
•
randomly to different units.
• In the case of price discounts, units refer to different days chosen randomly
since the quantity of sales may also depend on the day of the week.
It is possible that the weekend sales quantity may be higher than the sales quantity on
weekdays.]

Introduction to Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)
To understand whether the effect of different levels of a factor (such as
price discount) has any statistical significance on the population parameter
(such as average sales), we perform Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)
The objective of ANOVA is to check simultaneously whether the
means from more than two populations are different.

ONE-WAY ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE
(ANOVA)
In One-way ANOVA, we would like to study the impact of a single treatment
(also known as factor) at different levels (thus forming different groups) on a
continuous response variable (or outcome variable).
One-way ANOVA is appropriate under the following conditions:
1. In each group, the population response variable follows a normal distribution and the sample subjects are chosen using random sampling.
2. The population variances for different groups are assumed to be same. That is, variability in the response variable values within different groups is
same.

Violation of Assumptions in one-way
<b>ANOVA</b>
Although conditions 1 and 2 are necessary for one-way ANOVA, the model is
robust and minor violations of the assumptions may not result in incorrect decision
about the null hypothesis.
However, we need to check whether conditions 1 and 2 are met to ensure validity of
ANOVA as a good practice.
Normality assumption can be checked using P-P plot (probability-probability plot).
The equality of variance can be checked through the hypothesis test for equal
variance.

Setting up an one-way ANOVA
Assume that we would like to study the impact of a factor (such as discount)
with k levels on a continuous variable (such as sales quantity)
Then the null and alternative hypotheses for one-way ANOVA are given by:

<math>H_0: \mu_1 = \mu_2 = \mu_3 = \dots = \mu_k</math>
<math>H_{A}</math>: Not all <math>\mu</math> values are equal

Setting up an one-way ANOVA
• The One-way ANOVA model is specified as follows:
<math display="block">Y_{ij} = \mu + \tau_i + \varepsilon_{ij}</math>
<math>\mu</math> is the overall mean
<math>\tau_i</math> is the effect of factor <i>i</i> (or factor effect).
<math>\varepsilon_{ij}</math> is the error assumed to be a normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation <math>\sigma</math>.

Comparing Population means
<math>\mu_1</math>
<math>\mu_2</math>
<math>\mu_3</math>
Comparing three means (<math>\mu_1</math>, <math>\mu_2</math>, and <math>\mu_3</math>).

Setting up an one-way ANOVA
• Let
<math>k =</math> Number of groups (or samples)
<math>n_i</math> = Number of observations in group <math>i</math> (<math>i = 1, 2, ..., k</math>)
<math>n = \text{Total number of observations} \left( = \sum_{i=1}^{k} n_i \right)</math>
<math>Y_{ij}</math> = Observation <math>j</math> in group <math>i</math>
To arrive at the statistic, we decompose the total variation in Y into two components:
1. variations between groups (SSB)
2. variations within group (SSW)
SST=SSB+SSW
Then we carry out F-test.

Example
One of the steps involved in the processing of corn flakes for cereals involves
toasting the flakes. The table shows data for corn flakes thickness (mm) for four
different toasting times (seconds).

At the 0.05 level of significance, is there evidence of a difference in the mean
•
thickness of the corn flakes for the different toasting times?

TWO-WAY ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE
• The values of response variable may be influenced by several factors.
For example, in addition to price discounts, location of the stores may also
•
play an important role in the sales quantity.
• The discounts may not have much impact if the store is located near affluent
community compared to stores located near non-affluent community.
To understand the impact of both factors (price discount and location)
simultaneously on sales, two-way ANOVA can be carried out.

TWO-WAY ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE
• The specific questions the two-way ANOVA would answer are:
1. Are there differences in the average sales quantity with different levels
of price discounts?
2. Are there differences in the average sales quantity with respect to
different locations?
3. Are there interactions between price discounts and location with respect
to average sales quantity?

TWO-WAY ANOVA model The two-way ANOVA model can be expressed as <math display="block">Y_{iik} = \mu + \alpha_i + \beta_i + \alpha_i \beta_i + \varepsilon_{iik}</math> where <math>Y_{ijk}</math> = Value of the <math>k^{th}</math> observation (<math>k = 1, 2, ..., c</math>) of the response variable at level <math>i</math> (<math>i = 1, 2, ..., a</math>) of factor A and level <math>j</math> (<math>j = 1, 2, ..., b</math>) of factor B. <math>\mu</math> = Overall mean value of the response variable <math>Y_{iik}</math> <math>\alpha_i</math> = Level (effect) of factor <math>A</math> (<math>i = 1, 2, ..., a</math>) <math>\beta_i</math> = Level (effect) of factor <math>B</math> (<math>j = 1, 2, ..., b</math>) <math>\alpha_i \beta_i</math> = Interaction of <math>i^{th}</math> level of factor A and <math>j^{th}</math> level of factor B <math>\varepsilon_{iik}</math> = Error associated with <math>k^{th}</math> of observation at level <math>i</math> of factor A and level <math>j</math> of factor B.

Hypothesis Tests in TWO-WAY ANOVA
1. Test of Factor A Main Effects:
<math>H_0</math>: <math>\alpha_i = 0</math> for all <math>i</math> (<math>i = 1, 2, ..., a</math>)
The sum of squares in the case of two-way ANOVA
<math>H_{A}</math>: Not all <math>\alpha_{i}</math> are zero
with equal sample sizes is given by (Fisher, 1934)
2. Test of Factor B Main Effects:
<math>SST = SSA + SSB + SSAB + SSE</math>
<math>H_0: \beta_j = 0 \text{ for all } j (j = 1, 2, ..., b)</math>
<math>H_A</math>: Not all <math>\beta_i</math> are zero
3. Test of Interaction Effects:
<math>H_0: \alpha_i \beta_i = 0</math> for all <math>i</math> (<math>i = 1, 2, ..., a</math>) and <math>j</math> (<math>j = 1, 2, ..., b</math>)
<math>H_A</math>: Not all <math>\alpha_i \beta_i</math> are zero

Calculation Formulae in TWO-WAY ANOVA
1. Sum of squares of total deviation (SST):
<math display="block">SST = \sum_{i=1}^{a} \sum_{j=1}^{b} \sum_{k=1}^{c} (Y_{ijk} - \mu)^{2}</math>
where <i>c</i> is the number of observations in each group and <math>\mu</math> is the overall mean.
2. Sum of Squares of deviation due to Factor A
<math>SSA = b *c \sum (\mu_{Ai} - \mu)^2</math>
where <math>\mu_i</math> is the mean of all observations in level <i>i</i> of factor A
<i>c</i> is the number of observations in each group (assumed to be same for all groups).

Calculation Formulae in TWO-WAY ANOVA
3. Sum of Squares of deviation due to Factor B
<math display="block">SSB = a *c \sum (\mu_{Bi} - \mu)^2</math>
4. Sum of Squares of deviation due to interaction of Factor A and Factor B
<math display="block">SSAB = c \sum_{i} \sum_{j} (\mu_{ij} - \mu_{Ai} - \mu_{Bj} + \mu)^{2}</math>

Calculation Formulae in TWO-WAY ANOVA
5. Sum of squares of deviation within a group (SSW):
<math display="block">SSW = \sum_{i=1}^{a} \sum_{j=1}^{b} \sum_{k=1}^{c} (Y_{ijk} - \mu_{ij})^{2}</math>

Q. A nationwide company specializing in preparing students for college and graduate school
entrance exams, such as the SAT, ACT, GRE, and LSAT, had the business objective of
improving its ACT preparatory course. Two factors of interest to the company are the length
of the course (a condensed 10-day period or a regular 30-day period) and the type of
course (traditional classroom or online distance learning). The company collected data
by randomly assigning 4 clients to each of the four cells that represent a combination of
length of the course and type of course. Data shown in the table.
What are the effects of the type of course and the length of the course on ACT
scores?
