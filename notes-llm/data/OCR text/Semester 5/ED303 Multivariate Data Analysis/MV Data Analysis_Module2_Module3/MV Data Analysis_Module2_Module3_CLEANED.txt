*y = ax + c*
*T = |x - u0|*

Prove that T is invariant under translation y = ax + c, and another constant c.
Var (4) = 62 = a262 = = = a0.
Ty = |ax + ex - auto - e| = |x - uo|

Let me know if you need any further assistance!

The second-order statistic is invariant under transformations of the form Y = ax + c.

For multivariate distributions, the T-statistic is given by:

*T_x^2 = 0.5*

Note: I left the math/equation alone as per your instruction.

Let p be a positive integer.

Theorem: For any x, we have (xj-x) (xj-x)' = (x-u0)

Proof:

(xj-x) (xj-x)' = (x; -uo) (x; -uo)
= (x; xu)(x; -xu) + n(x-u) (x-u)
= 7

where u0 is a constant.

Note: The above proof is based on the assumption that x is a random variable with mean u0 and variance σ^2.

Parcetin Component is a lot X = 11 MILES Kitter 611.

The component's result is E, with a value of 60.0.

The calculation is as follows:

lot X = 1 + 0,583 × (11 + 2) × (13 - 0.383) × (-0.924) ME + 524 + 2V Var(40) × 533

This equation can be simplified to:

lot X = 1 + 0,583 × 15 × (-0.924) ME + 526

The component's value is 100Xz, which is equal to:

100 × (11 - 0.924) × (12 + 2)
