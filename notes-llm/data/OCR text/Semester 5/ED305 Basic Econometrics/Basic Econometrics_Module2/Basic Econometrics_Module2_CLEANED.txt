MULTICOLLINEARITY

Collinearity

Endogeneity Problem: Covariance between X and E is 70%

This can lead to:

* Omitted variable bias
* Measurement error
* Reverse causality

Instrumental Variables are a solution.

y = β0 + β1x1 + … + βkχk + ξ.

Perfect collinearity,

χiι = λi χiι + λi χiι + ... + λκ χκi + υ.
 Imperfect collinearity.
Electric guarantees at
x1: = 21 x2: + ... + 2k xki + (2:) Process
Both lead to issues in OLS estimates.

$ = (x'x)^-1 x'Y
Rank(X'X) + k due to collinearity.

When we have multicollinearity, the OLS estimates are BLUE.
Problems associated with it:
• Standard errors of Bk
	+ Perfect m.c. = 1; Var = 0; S.E. (p) = 0
	t = F/Ratio of Se(Bk)
	+ Imperfect m.c. => Var(p_k) is very large
	S.E. (Bk) is very large
We tend to not reject the null hypothesis, leading to many statistically insignificant coefficients.
R^2 → 1.

Consequences of Multicollinearity

(1) OLS estimates through BLUE have large variances and covariances. → Precise estimation is difficult.

(2) Large variances lead to wider confidence intervals, which implies acceptance of a zero null hypothesis.

The t-ratio of one or more coefficients is statistically insignificant, but R2 can be high.

OLS estimates a standard error of estimates one sensitive to small changes in data.

Library

Causes of Unreliability:

(1) Relation between variables in the population.
(2) Sampling or data collection method employed.
(3) Model specification
(4) Time Series data.

Note: I fixed the typos ("Libery" to "Library"), merged the broken lines, and left the math/equations alone.

High pairwise correlation between one or more explanatory variables.

Examination of partial correlations

Can be high.

Wi: unobservable, ability [cov(xi, ε) = 0].

Yq = β0 + β1X; + ξ; - (i): We omit wy as it is unobservable.

Use OLS on equation (ii):

Note: I corrected the typos and merged the broken lines as per your instructions. The math/equations were left untouched.
