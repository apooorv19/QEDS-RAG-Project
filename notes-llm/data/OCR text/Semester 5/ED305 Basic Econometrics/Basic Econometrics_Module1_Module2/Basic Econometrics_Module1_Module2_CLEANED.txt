One thing to note about x is important: n>(K+1).

The estimated regression coefficient, denoted by hat beta, is equal to (x'x)^-1 times x'Y.

The variance of x, denoted by E(XX), is equal to the sum of the squared differences between each data point and the mean of x, minus two times the product of the mean of x and the mean of y.

Note: The math equations were left unchanged as per instruction.
