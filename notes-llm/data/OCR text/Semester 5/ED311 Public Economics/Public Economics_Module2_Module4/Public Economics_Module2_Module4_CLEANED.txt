Page No. S: Public Goods

The concept of public goods refers to three types of goods that have externalities, which are benefits or costs that affect individuals other than the buyer or seller. These goods include:

* Households
* Individuals
* Firms

Redistribution (more) is a key aspect of public goods, as they can be publicly provided and privately consumed.

Public Goods and Externality (Pollution)

Classic Example: Littering and Farbage

Those who are not paying cannot benefit from public goods. Free riding is a problem that cannot be denied.

Example: A classic example of this is when people do not pay for the use of a public good, such as a park or beach, but still enjoy its benefits.

Public Goods are non-rivalrous and non-excludable.

Sustainable Development Cost: Pollution Abatement

The marginal cost of pollution reduction for MCA (100) is $0, indicating that there are no additional costs associated with reducing pollution by 100 units. This suggests that the optimal level of pollution reduction is achieved at a marginal cost of $0.

In contrast, the marginal cost of pollution reduction for MD (13) is $57, indicating that there are significant additional costs associated with reducing pollution by 13 units. This suggests that the optimal level of pollution reduction may not be achieved at this level of reduction.

Subject: Pomoe (Project on Money and Budgeting)

Objective: To understand the concept of budgeting and its importance in our daily lives.

Materials:

* A piece of paper
* A pen or pencil
* A calculator (optional)

Procedure:

1. Write down your income for a month.
2. List all your expenses, including necessities like food, shelter, clothing, and entertainment.
3. Calculate the total amount spent on each category.
4. Determine how much you have left over after paying all your bills.

Conclusion:
A budget is an essential tool in managing our finances effectively. By tracking our income and expenses, we can make informed decisions about how to allocate our resources wisely.

Note: This project is designed for students to learn about the concept of budgeting and its importance in their daily lives.
