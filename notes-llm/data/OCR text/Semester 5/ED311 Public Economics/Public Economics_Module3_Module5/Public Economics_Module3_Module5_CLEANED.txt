Confrontation Paradox. Intransitivity of Group Preferences

The intransitivity of group preferences yields the confrontation paradox, which states that a group may have different rankings for two alternatives when each individual has a consistent ranking. This phenomenon can be observed in many real-world situations.

Generation of Social Transitivity: Median Theorem

One way to resolve this paradox is through the generation of social transitivity using the median theorem. This theorem states that if all individuals have single-peaked preferences, then the group's preference ordering will also be single-peaked and transitive.

Single-Peaked Preferences

In particular, when individual preferences are single-peaked, the group's preference ordering will always be transitive. This is because each individual's preference ordering can be represented as a curve that peaks at some point, and the median of these curves will always be transitive.

Note: The original text appears to have been written in a hurry, with typos and broken lines. I've done my best to correct the errors and make the text readable while preserving the mathematical equations and notation.

Policy space is one-dimensional. When the policy space is one-dimensional, sufficient but not necessary conditions for the existence of a Condorcet winner given by the Median Voter Theorem are satisfied.

Assumption: Suppose there are odd numbers of voters, policy space is one-dimensional, and the voters have single-peaked preferences.

Then, the median of the distribution of voters' preferred options is a Conferred Winner. Reference to the Torrance axiom is replaced; we do not know.
