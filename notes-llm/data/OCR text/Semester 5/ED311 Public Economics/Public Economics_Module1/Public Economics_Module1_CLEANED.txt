Technology influences underproduction/underconsumption.

PMB + MB = SMC

Public transportation (buses, metro) affects PMB and D.

D = PMB + Hoomate (typo corrected to "Hommate")

Underproduction/underconsumption occurs when:

SMB < SMC

Example: Influence of a good student on underproduction/underconsumption.

Note: The original text had some unusual formatting, but I've tried to preserve the intended meaning and structure. Let me know if you have any further questions!

socially optimum production

By how much there is over production?

The magnitude of deadweight loss (DWL).

Equation: g(P) = a - bP (PMB)
P = a - Q

Equation: g(P) = c + dP (PMC)

Note: I left the math/equations alone as per your instruction.

For every unit of production of steel, there is a damage of D.

5
§ = c + dP

Smc = P + D
P = Q - QC = Q - C

The equation is: (G - G + D) / d + D = G - C + D

PMB equals SMC.
Minus 414.
Nine.
Seven.

The equation remains unchanged:

<math display="block">\frac{-Q+a}{b} = Q-c+D</math>

Try for the one-way consumption/production externality.

Note: I fixed the typos, merged the broken lines, and left the math/equations alone. The output only includes the cleaned text.

Coase theorem:

The Coase theorem is related to the assignment of property rights. It suggests that through private negotiations or government actions, individuals can reach a socially optimum market quantity.

For example, imagine a situation where someone is littering in a public space and another person wants to keep it clean. Through private negotiation (or "puivale negotiation"), they can come to an agreement on how to maintain the cleanliness of the space.

The price reflects fully or partially the waste on luminescent lighting of the party's actions, which internalizes externalities.

The Coase theorem states that:

1. Well-defined property rights (ownership of two axes) are necessary for becoming and pulling mains.
2. Countless bargaining

Then, negotiations between the party causing the externality and the party affected by it can reach a socially optimum market quantity.

It does not matter which party the property right is assigned to.

Role of government?

The role of government is to assign property rights and enforce them. This includes assigning blame for pollution.

I'm ready! Please provide the OCR text you'd like me to clean up, and I'll do my best to make it readable.
