If ED = 0, inelastic demand shifts entirely to Consumers.

And is the burden holder.
Period: 127

If ES = 0, inelastic supply.

Quality of service star P equals quality of best effort star P cubed.

Quality of service star P equals quality of best effort star P plus at.

P equals P*.

P* equals P plus at.

Pt equals 0 implies Pt greater than 0.

Pt equals 0 is equivalent to Pt greater than 0.

Summary of Holistic Rapining Cat & Pt + DWL

Pt = Po + at

DWB = -1 dQ/dt
= -1 * S'[P] * dP/dt

Q = S(P)
QQ = S'(P) * dP/dt

DWB = P * S'(P)

DEDdt = 2 * S(P) * (dt)^2
-1 * EC * ED
= 9 * at * Es - ED

Date: _____

If we're taxing the inelastic side of the market, then demand will be reduced by 2500-2070.

DWB it reduces with absolute size of elasticities.
Relatively more efficient to tax inelastic goods.

Mutual effect of fax machines on traffic.

But this is not fair. An ex-tax analysis of an elastic good shows that it is better to tax a commodity at some tax rate than to tax the same commodity at a higher tax rate.

It is also better to have a marginal tax rate or incremental increase in tax (tax) because of the squared term (dt)^2 involved in about these equations.

Date: ______/_____

Now, what is the optimal tax rate?

If elasticities for k goods are different (not optimal),
Ramsey's formula states that the optimal tax rate is such that the marginal deadweight loss (DWL) for the last unit of tax collected is equal across all the goods.

Note: I left the math/equations alone as per your instruction.

10% inc 1.1t, 1.1tz
If DOW = DOWN The Hum the fax rule to and to will give you the optimal fix rate.
One important aspect of taxation is vindication.

Ability to Pay Approach?

How the tax system redistributes income to make it more equitable?

4. Vertical Equity
Vertical equity is the principle that groups with more resources should pay higher taxes than groups with fewer resources.

Horizontal Equity
The principle of horizontal equity states that similar individuals who make different economic choices should be taxed similarly by the tax system.
Example: Rich and poor - same tax rate if both buying a house on the market.
This can lead to issues such as progressive taxation and regressive taxation.
