Public goods: Definition, models of efficient allocation, pure and impure public goods, free riding.

Provisioning public goods involves externalities.

Garbage and Littering

Garbage littering around us

Municipality should collect garbage and manage waste. However, garbage continues to rot in the streets.

Why not engage a private service to pick up their trash?

Financed by a voluntary fee paid by neighborhood residents, this system faces the classic free rider problem.

Any resident could continue to throw his trash in the dumpsters and then refuse to pay his share of the trash collection fee, with the hope that his neighbors would pick up the costs for him.

The free rider gets all the benefits of trash collection but pays none of the costs. Eventually, the number of free riders might grow large enough that the town would not be able to raise sufficient funds to finance the trash collection from a private company.

Goods that suffer from this freedom

Is the good rival in consumption? Yes No economics as public goods Private good Impure public good Yes (cable TV) (ice cream)

Whether a good is private or public depends on whether it is rival and excludable. Pure private goods, such as ice cream, are both rival and excludable. Pure public goods, such as national defense, are neither rival nor excludable. Goods that are rival but not excludable, and vice versa, are impure public goods.

Note: I fixed typos, merged broken lines, left math/equations alone, and output only the cleaned text.

Definitions
• Pure public goods: Goods that are perfectly non-rival in consumption and are non-excludable.

Non-rival in consumption

One individual's consumption of a good does not affect another's opportunity to consume the good.

Non-excludable

Individuals cannot deny each other the opportunity to consume a good.

Impure Public Goods

Goods that satisfy the two public good conditions (non-rival in consumption and non-excludable) to some extent, but not fully. This includes goods that may not meet one or both of these criteria, but still exhibit some characteristics of a public good.

• Free Rider Problem
When an investment has a personal cost but a common benefit, individuals will underinvest.

Externality

• Externalities arise whenever the actions of one party make another party worse or better off, yet the first party neither bears the costs nor receives the benefits of doing so. Example: Global warming due to emissions of fossil fuels is a classic example of what economists call an externality.

Externalities may be small or localized (smoking by a friend), or they can be large-scale (global warming, acid rain, etc.). Externalities are an example of market failures.

• Market failure: A problem that causes the market economy to deliver an outcome that does not maximize efficiency.
• Externalities can arise either from the production of goods or from their consumption.

Price of Social marginal steel cost. SMC equals When a firm's production reduces the well-being of others who are not compensated by the firm.

Deadweight loss = Private marginal cost, PMC + Marginal Damage (MD).

Private Marginal Cost (PMC)

$100 = Marginal damage, MD
The direct cost to producers of producing an additional unit of a good. This is known as the marginal cost.

Marginal cost (MC) = Private marginal benefit,
D

Social Marginal Cost (SMC)

PMB equals Social Marginal Benefit, SMB. The private marginal cost to producers plus any costs associated with the production of the good that are imposed on others is the Overproduction.

Negative consumption externality

FIGURE 5-3: Price of Cigarettes (per pack)

Consumption Externalities in the Cigarette Market. A negative consumption externality of $0.40 per pack of cigarettes consumed leads to a social marginal benefit that is below the private marginal benefit, and a social optimum quantity (Q2) that is lower than the competitive market equilibrium quantity (Q1). There is overconsumption (Q1 - Q2), with an associated deadweight loss of area ACB.

Social Marginal Benefit (SMB) = Private Marginal Benefit (PMB) - Marginal Damage (MD)

Social Optimum Quantity (Q2)
Quantity of Cigarettes (in packs)

Positive production externality

FIGURE 5-4

Market Failure Due to Positive Production Externality in the Oil Exploration Market: Expenditures on oil exploration by any company have a positive externality because they offer more profitable opportunities for other companies.

This leads to a social marginal cost that is below the private marginal cost, and a social optimum quantity (Q2) that is greater than the competitive market equilibrium quantity (Q1). There is underproduction of oil exploration, with an associated deadweight loss of area ABC.

Smoking and Externalities

TABLE 6-1: The Effects of Smoking: Externalities or Not?

An externality if...

Effect
Not an externality if...

Increased health care costs
Many individuals are insured by entities that spread the health costs of smokers among all of the insured; also, the health costs of the uninsured are passed on to others. Insurance companies actuarially raise premiums for smokers.

Less-productive workers
Employers adjust individuals' wages according to individual productivity, so that they must lower wages for all workers to offset productivity loss. Employers do not adjust wages according to.

Increased number of fires
The fires damage nonsmokers' property, raising the risk of damage to others. Smokers set fire only to their own property, requiring no help from the fire department. The cost of insuring against fire damage can be adjusted by local fire departments or insurance companies according to an individual's smoking status. Nonsmokers save money because smokers tend to die earlier, which means they do not pay Social Security taxes or incur medical costs later in life, allowing them to collect full benefits sooner. Additionally, the deaths of smokers reduce high health care costs near the end of life, a positive externality.

Smoking also has negative effects on secondhand smoke exposure, which can have serious consequences for their families' utility when deciding to smoke. Cigarette smoking has numerous physical and financial effects, but in many cases, these may not be considered externalities. This table lists examples of the effects of smoking. The second column discusses the situations under which these are not externalities, and the third column discusses the situations under which they are externalities.

Solutions to Externalities

• Private-Sector Solutions to Negative Externalities: Coase Theorem
• Public-Sector Remedies for Externalities
• Corrective Taxation ("Pigouvian taxation")
• Subsidies
• Regulation

The Coase Theorem

• How a market might compensate those affected by an externality
• Through property rights
• Internalizing the Externality: When either private negotiations or government action lead the price to fully reflect the external costs or benefits of that party's actions.
• Steel Plant and Fishermen Example

Coase Theorem: When there are well-defined property rights and costless bargaining, then negotiations between the party creating the externality and the party affected by the externality can bring about the socially optimal market quantity. This theorem states that externalities do not necessarily create market failures, because negotiations between the parties can lead the offending producers (or consumers) to internalize the externality, or account for the external effects in their production (or consumption).

The efficient solution to an externality does not depend on which party is assigned the property rights, as long as someone is assigned those rights.

Role for the government in dealing with externalities: establishing property rights. If the government can establish and enforce those property rights, then the private market will do the rest.

Problems with Coase Theorem

The Assignment Problem

The first problem involves assigning blame/assigning damage. The significance of the assignment problem as a barrier to internalizing the externality depends on the nature of the externality - clear cases of assignment versus unclear cases. For example, global warming.

The holdout problem, which can arise when the property rights in question are held by more than one party: the shared property rights give each owner power over all others - common property resources.

The Free Rider Problem - when an investment has a personal cost but a common benefit, individuals will underinvest.

Transaction Costs and Negotiating Problems - it is hard to negotiate when there are large numbers of individuals on one or both sides of the negotiation.

Corrective Taxation: "Pigouvian taxation • taxing the producer an amount of tax that equals marginal damage (MD) for each unit produced • Given the externality with a cost of MD, the socially optimal production is at point B, where social price of marginal costs and benefits are equal. Taxation as a Solution to Negative Steel Production Externalities in the Steel Market. A tax of $100 per unit (equal to the marginal damage) increases the firm's private act as another input cost for the steel producer, and shifts its private marginal cost curve from PMC1 to PMC2, which coincides with the socially optimal production level." Cost Curve: The quantity produced falls from Q1 to Q2, the socially optimal level of production. Just as with the Coasian payment, this tax internalizes the externality and removes the inefficiency of the negative externality. This will result in a new PMC curve, PMC2, which is identical to the SMC curve. As a result, the tax effectively internalizes the externality and leads to the socially optimal outcome at point B, quantity Q2.

Subsidies

Not all externalities are negative.

In case of positive externalities, the beneficiaries can pay to the producer for the benefit. Positive Production Externalities in the Market for Oil Exploration • A subsidy that is equal to the marginal benefit from oil exploration reduces the production of goods with positive externalities. The government can achieve the same outcome by making a payment, or a subsidy to the producer. The amount of this subsidy would exactly equal the benefit to the others – reduced cost for the producer – more production.

Note: I left the math equation alone as per your instruction.

Regulation: Putting a limit or cap on the amount of pollution/emissions. Cost of MCR pollution reduction ($): MC 8.10, MC<T>, MC $100. MD = SMB. MCA.100, 100. The optimal level of reduction for the market is the point at which the sum of marginal costs equals marginal damage (at point Z), where plant A has a lower marginal cost of pollution reduction at each level of reduction than does plant B. Pollution Reduction with Multiple Firms: Plant A has a lower marginal cost of pollution reduction at each level of reduction than does plant B. The optimal level of reduction for the market is the point at which the sum of marginal costs equals marginal damage (at point Z), where 150 - 200 - 250 -. With a reduction of 200 units. An equal reduction of 100 units for each plant is inefficient since the marginal cost to plant B (MC_B) is so much higher than the marginal cost to plant A (MC_A). The optimal division of this reduction is where each plant's marginal cost is equal to the social marginal benefit (which is equal to marginal damage). This occurs when plant A reduces by 150 units and plant B reduces by 50 units, at a marginal cost to each of $100.

Which method should be used? Depends on the information the government has and the uncertainty about that information.

Tradeable Emission Permits

Combines quantity restrictions and taxes

Tradable emissions permits are issued to firms, which can then be traded.

Key advantage (for economists) of a price policy or tradable permits:

The price of emissions is the same for all, which is efficient.

<b>Corrective Taxes vs Tradeable Permits</b>

• Initial allocation of permits: If the government sells them to firms, this is equivalent to a tax.
• If the government gives them to current firms for free, this is like the tax plus a large transfer to initial polluting firms.
• Uncertainty in marginal costs: With uncertainty in the costs of reducing pollution, a tax cannot target a specific quantity, while tradeable permits can.
• Taxes are preferable when the marginal damage (MD) curve is flat. Tradable permits are preferable when the MD curve is steep.

Horizontal Summation in Private Goods Markets

In private goods markets, we horizontally sum the demands of Ben and Jerry to get market demand for ice cream cones. If Ben demands 2 ice cream cones at $2, and Jerry demands 1 ice cream cone at $2, then at a market price of $2 the quantity demanded in the market is 3 ice cream cones.

MU^B_ic/MU^B_c = MRS^B_ic,c = MRS^J_ic,c = P_ic/P_c

MC_ic = P_ic
MRS = MC

FIGURE 7-2

(a) Vertical Summation in Public Goods Markets. For public goods, we vertically sum the demands of Ben and Jerry to get the social value of the public good.

If Ben is willing to pay $1 for the fifth missile, and Jerry is willing to pay $2 for the fifth missile, then society values that fifth missile at $3. Given the private supply curve for missiles, the optimal number of missiles to produce is five, where social marginal benefit ($3) equals social marginal cost ($3).

Note: I left the math equation alone as per your instruction.

Social efficiency is maximized when the marginal cost is set equal to the sum of the MRSs, rather than being set equal to each individual's MRS. For private goods, it is optimal for firms to produce until the marginal cost equals the benefit to the marginal consumer. For public goods, however, it is socially optimal for firms to produce until the marginal cost equals the benefit to all consumers combined. The public good is non-rival: since it can be consumed jointly by all consumers, society would like the producer to take into account the sum of all consumers' preferences.
