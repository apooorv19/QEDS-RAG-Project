Degenerate Distribution: It is an one-point distribution.

1. A variable v.v X has a degenerate distribution at 0.
X ~ Degenerate(0)
P(X=0) = 1

(There is only one distribution that has a variance of 0.)

Moment Generating Function: M_X(t) = e^(t)

Note: This is not a Bernoulli distribution, but rather a degenerate distribution.

The probability mass function for a binomial distribution is given by:

The expected value of X is given by:

E(X) = pV(X) = pq = p(1-p)

The moment generating function for the binomial distribution is given by:

Mgf: M(x) = e^(tx)

This can be expanded as:

= ge^0 + pe^(t)
= (1-p)t + pe^t

The cumulative distribution function for the binomial distribution is given by:

edf: F_X(x) = P(X ≤ x)

This can be written as:

= ∑k=0∞ P(X ∈ k)
= ∑k=0∞ ⎣⎢n⎡k⎤p^k(1-p)^{n-k}

The expected value of X is given by:

E(X) = mp = m(1-p)

Note: The Binomial distribution becomes a Bernoulli distribution when n = 1.

Geometric Distribution:

X² = Number of failures before 1st success
X₁ ∈ {0, 1, 2, 3, ...}

X₂ = Number of trials required to get 1st success
P(X₁ = x) = q^x \* p, x = 0, 1, 2, ...

P(X₂ = x) = q^(x-1) \* p, x = 1, 2, 3, ...

Relation between X₁ and X₂: No. of failures + No. of successes = No. of trials

E(X₁) = q
E(X₂) = X₁q = (a) X₁

Var(X₁) = 1/2
Var(X₂) = 1/2

Hypergeometric distribution (without replacement)

X ~ Hypergeometric(N, M, n)

A box contains N objects, of which N-M are of one kind (type 1) and M-N are of another kind (type 2). The number drawn is denoted by X.

X ∈ {0, 1, 2, …, min(n, m)}

P(X = x) = (m choose x) × (N - m choose n - x), for x = 0, 1, 2, …, min(n, m)

E(X) = m
Var(X) = m × (N - m) × (N - m)

That's a distribution that's also known as Beta or Beda. It's a continuous probability distribution on the unit interval [0,1]. The probability density function (pdf) is given by:

f(x) = x^(α-1) (1-x)^(β-1), 0 ≤ x ≤ 1

The expected value E(x) is simply α.

This distribution has no closed-form expression for its moment-generating function M_x(t). When d=1, it reduces to the exponential distribution.

Date Bida - II distribution, also known as Beda prime distribution, X~ Beda I (x, B) where x, B > 0. The support of this distribution is [0, ∞).

The probability density function (pdf) is given by:

f(x) = (x^α-1)/(β(α, β)) × (1+x)^(α+β)

The expected value E(X) is α, and the variance Var(X) is:

Var(X) = (α + β - 1)/((β - 1)^2(β - 2))

where β/α > 2. The moment Mx(t) exists but not in closed form.

The beta function is defined as:

B(α, β) = Γ(α) × Γ(β)

where Γ(z) is the gamma function, which is given by:

Γ(z) = ∫ x^(z-1) dx

Note: The cleaned text maintains the original mathematical equations and notation. e^(-x) dx, α ≥ 0

If λ = 0 and μ = 0, it will become a standard Cauchy distribution:

Hence, E(x) = ∫x π(1+n^2) dx = -0 + 1

-ρ π(1+n^2) = R-1

But still mean does not exist why?
Because it does not converge absolutely
(a, a) = A = toyle

The reason is that the integral diverges.

To an unbiased estimator does not exist. However, it can be asymptotically unbiased.

A necessary condition for a statistic to be an unbiased estimator of 0 is that E(X) = 0.

The variance of X is defined as Var(X) = E(X^2) - (E(X))^2.

It is also true that E(X; -X) = 0, and Van(X; -X) = (E(X; -X))^2.

A statistic is officially unbiased if it is an asymptotically unbiased estimator of a parameter.

An estimator of 0 is asymptotically unbiased if lim E(Tn) = 0 + 0 as n → ∞.

To be clear, not all statistics are unbiased estimators. However, some statistics can be asymptotically unbiased even though they are not unbiased.

In particular, T1, T2, T3, T4, T5, and T6 are unbiased estimators, while Ts and Ta are not unbiased estimators.

Daly C

Unbiased estimators are also asymptotically unbiased, but converse is not true.
Bias is a number.

Bias of an estimator:
If the estimator of θ is T, then bias of T is defined as:

BIAS(T) = E[T - θ] = E[T] - θ
An estimator T is said to be unbiased if and only if BIAS(T) = 0

One estimator that can be unbiased in practice such as Mederson's (1994) is to put a hat on an unbaised estimator. Let Huorem be that.

The consistency of T is defined as:

lim n→∞ E(T) = 0 and lim n→∞ Var(T) = 0

The probability density function (PDF) of a Poisson distribution with parameter λ is given by:

f(x) = θe^(-θx}, x ≥ 0

where θ is the rate parameter.

The log-likelihood function L(θ) can be written as:

L(θ) = ∑[i=1 to ∞] xi log(xi) - xi

The first derivative of the log-likelihood function with respect to θ is:

d/dθ(log(L(θ))) = n/θ - ∑[i=1 to ∞] xi \* nx_i

The second derivative of the log-likelihood function with respect to θ is:

That a random sample X1, X2, ..., Xm, X3 from M(0,1) is most efficient estimator of 0?

The probability density function f_0(x) = (1/√(2π)) e^(-((x-0)^2)/2) is equal to log(1/√(2K)).

Lagging x by -1 gives us the expression:

log(f(n)) = n - 0

For I(O), we have d²/log(f(a)) = -1.

The CKLB (8) equation is:

I(0) = n

The mean, denoted by X̄, equals G(E(x)) = 4.

Variance of the estimator is unbounded. Therefore, X is most efficient estimator of Ø.

An estimator T is a sufficient estimator of θ (200) if and only if the conditional distribution of X1, X2, ..., Xn given T = t is independent of θ.

In other words: P(X1=x1, X2=x2, X3=x3, ..., Xn=xn | T=t) is proportional to 0.

The state of a property of a company can be described by the following equation: L(0) = h(11, 12, ..., xn). g(T,0) where h(n_1, n_2, ..., n_n) is a function of 0 and g(T, 0) contains n_1, n_2, ..., n_n only through T. If T is sufficient estimator of O.

For example, X1, X2 are independent and identically distributed Poisson variables with parameter 0, then L(0) = P(X1 = x1). P(X2 = x2).

The likelihood function L(θ) is given by:

L(θ) = 1/(e^(-2θ) \* θ^(π_1 + π_2))

A fr of complete and sufficient estimator colich is unbaised estimator of 0 becomes UMVUE of O.
i.e; let T be a complete and sufficient estimatou p.t
E(g(T))=0 Shen g(T) is UMVUE of O.
