The important point to note here is that the factor price equalization theorem holds true. Prices are equalized across countries despite one country being labor-abundant and the other being capital-abundant. This interesting possibility arises because of the irrelevance of factor endowment conditions and the fact that factor prices are solely and uniquely determined by commodity prices. Thus, free commodity movement acts as a substitute for international factor movements.

Trade restriction policies include:

(1) Import Tariffs
(2) Import Quotas
(iii) Export Tax

By the Heckscher-Ohlin (HO) Theorem, the relatively labor-rich country is essentially a net exporter of labor and net importer of capital.

Voluntary Export Restraints

An importer of capital is a country that has a surplus of capital and imports more goods than it exports. Conversely, an exporter of capital is a country that has a shortage of capital and exports more goods than it imports.

Trade promotion policies include both export and import promotion. The former aims to increase the volume of exports from a country, while the latter aims to increase the volume of imports into a country.

There are several types of trade interventions that governments can use to influence international trade. These include:

- Regulating or affecting the prices of traded goods, such as tariffs, export taxes, subsidies, and pollution content tariffs.
- Regulating the volume of exports or imports, including quantitative restrictions (QRs) or non-tariff barriers (NTBs) to trade, such as import quotas, voluntary export notification restraints, and environmental standards.

As a consequence, the import volume falls to M(t) = a'b!

Import Tariff [Partial Equilibrium Analysis]

(9) The import tariff generates protection for local computer producers. Competition from efficient competing goods in the home country, say locally manufactured goods, is reduced.

Let me know if you need any further assistance!

Foreign producers are now restricted by the tariff. Produced computers. Suppose, imported computers and this enables them to produce more computers than the locally produced ones. As a result, local producers gain in terms of local market share as well as producers' surplus. An increase in producers' surplus (paa'pd) represents an increase in producers' surplus.

The domestic consumers now pay a higher price for both imported and locally produced computers. They buy less now, and suffer utility losses as a result.

If the free trade price nation is Da, the country measured by the decline in the consumer's surplus imports M = ab units of computers, which represents a decrease in consumers' surplus.

Excess demand in the home country at the market (1811) The domestic government earns a tariff revenue at that price.

The total surplus declared by the DAA'c and Abb'd. Now, suppose an ad-valorem tariff at the rate 0 < t < 1 is imposed by the home country on the import of computers. This raises the domestic import price of computers to (1 + t)P" at the initial price.

In partial equilibrium analysis, the economy loses at the initial TOT. P" = (1 + t)P"

The total loss in consumer surplus is redistributed among domestic producers as an increase in their surplus. The higher domestic price of computers raises local production and lowers local demand for computers.

On the other hand, local production and supply is more elastic. Thus, the same and substituted commodities constitute the dead-weight loss from the imposition of an ad-valorem import tariff, at the initial Tariff of Trade (TOT). These ad-valorem import tariffs, at the rate of 10.1%, cause similar effects such as increasing two components of the deadweight loss: production losses and consumption losses respectively. It seems that trade restrictions through an import tariff are not good for the economy as a whole. Production losses arise because an import tariff replaces in part the low-cost and efficient foreign supply by the high-cost and inefficient local production, benefiting local producers more than local consumers. The reduction in the consumption of computers may have protective and welfare effects, but these benefits can be offset by the higher twiff-inclusive price of imports on the rest of the economy and the world. Computers are considered in general equilibrium.

The magnitude of these deadweight losses (DWL) depends on three factors: revenue motive, revenue maximizing tariff rate, and price elasticity of demand for computers (M). Additionally, the price elasticity of supply for computers is greater than one (Em > 1).

A more elastic demand curve means that a 10% increase in the tariff-inclusive domestic relative price will cause the demand for computers to decline by a larger magnitude. Than when the demand curve is loss-elastic. Tariff Rate (t) → X

General Equilibrium Analysis

The total revenue curve starts from the origin because zero tariff (or free trade) does not generate any revenue. In general equilibrium setup:

(i) An import tariff changes the production rate so that no revenue is earned either. This tariff rate is the prohibitive rate.

For positive tariff rates less than one, tariff revenue increases as the tariff rate rises.

A strictly concave function: of it first increases across different sectors. With the tariff rate and beyond a critical rate, the volume of trade (VOT) changes accordingly. It initially increases as the tariff rate rises, but declines with further increase in the tariff rate.

An increase in wheat raises the domestic price

The change in voter turnout consequent upon an increase of imported computers proportionally for a given time period, support tariff may change the country's economy and consequently lower the import volume.

Total revenue increases if this fall in import volume is less than proportionate to the price increase, imposing a smaller or larger tariff, i.e. depending on whether the country is a net importer or exporter, and how the tariff rate compares to the world market.

Import demand is inelastic. Otherwise, when import revenue is spent by the government. Demand is elastic, twiff revenue declines with an increase in the price rate. Respectively, both his excess demand for computers (the have of sports) and the excess supply of titles (H.)

Volume of exports declines. That is, an import tariff lowers the volume of trade. As a consequence, the economy unambiguously loses.

Consider a small economy producing computers (being imported) and textiles (being exported). The welfare loss arises on two counts: (i) A tariff now reallocates resources towards the production of the import-competing good in which the country has a comparative disadvantage.

For a given TOT (17), a 10% ad-valorem tariff exists. There is thus a specialization loss.

On the import of computers, this raises its domestic price by 6 percentage points.

(ii) Domestic consumers are forced to pay a higher tariff-inclusive relative price by the same percentage points. This higher relative price for computers will encourage domestic production of computers.

However, if initially all resources were fully employed

In the production of these two goods, expansion in the production of computers must draw resources from the textile sector, thereby causing a contraction of this sector. Thus, an increase in domestic demand for computers expands the domestic import competing sector and contracts the export sector. In the other hand, higher domestic relative price of computers shifts consumption away from computers to textiles.

Consequently, both the excess demand for computers (the volume of imports) and the excess supply of textiles (the volume of exports) are affected.

(B) Large Country / Economy: Higher the trade rate, the smaller is the volume of trade and hence lower is its impact on national welfare. That is, the welfare of a large country with its VOT (Value Of Trade) monotonically decreases as the tariff rate is raised successively. The twiff revenue is redistributed among domestic consumers in a lump-sum manner.

A tariff raises the domestic price and lowers the export demand by the absolute value of the Export Demand Elasticity (E) at the margin. In contrast, since the redistribution of tariff never raises the income of consumers, they praise their import demand by the value of marginal Tariff Rate - propensity to consume at the margin. Marginal. We are falling until the probability tariff rate clicks. The import demand elasticity has three components: one and prohibits all trade. The real exchange remains (i) compensated price elasticity of demand for the

Import good that captures the pure substitution effect of a change in the domestic relative price (pd), reduction of tariff notes monotonically naive to the welfare of a small open economy. Thus, free trade Emported good that captures the real income as its best policy as far as the national welfare of the economy is concerned.

Not and at initial To Hoc 70T

An import tariff shifts the home country's offer curve to the left since at the initial TOT, a lower competing good) volume of exports can finance its smaller imports. It is then immediate that a tariff imposed by a large country on its imports of computers will demand. That is, the tariff-imposing home country's terms of trade (TOT) improve in its favor. This is because as the offer of exports falls when it imposes an import tariff, it generates an incentive to lower its import demand, necessitating an even smaller export at the initial TOT. The country being large, a fall in its import bill allows it to finance its imports and consequent excess supply. Overall, there is an improvement for the large tariff-imposing country. Country A is significant enough to lower the world's relative price under the assumption that the twelfth revenue is redistributed among domestic consumers at a lump-sum price of computers. Excess supply of computers brings a real income gain. The reason is excess demand for textiles, which means that the country can now buy its imports cheaper and sell its exports dearer.

Infant Industry Argument for Protection: Why Infant Industries Require Protection

The infant industry argument for protection is essentially a dynamic argument. It rests on the premise that a newly developed industry requires protection from foreign competition in its initial formative years when production and other operational costs are high.

As the industry grows over time and attains its optimum scale of operations, average costs come down and it can then face foreign competition. The counterargument is that an infant industry being protected by a tariff (or an import quota) and thus having a sizeable share of the market, will eventually become strong enough to compete with foreign industries.

Note: I left the math equation alone as per your instruction. Domestic market: For t less than topt, TOT exceeds VOT, and will never have the urge to grow and become more efficient. Therefore, the welfare rises monotonically. Moreover, in a dynamic world with a fast charging technology frontier, firms survive by innovation and continuous upgrading of their production technologies that lower the costs of production or improve the product quality. Welfare is still maximum.

For t equal to topt, TOT equals VOT, and lower the costs of production or emprove the product quality. Welfare is still maximum.

For t greater than topt, TOT less than VOT, Infant industries become complacent by their assured profits in the protected domestic markets, and do not invest in technological innovations. Therefore, the welfare falls monotonically.

Metzler Paradox

For a large country, a tariff lowers the world price of imports and thus makes foreign goods more competitive. If the world price falls too much, the twiff-inclusive domestic relative price of imports may decline as well. This will cause the domestic import-competing industries to contract.

A tariff-imposing country simply cannot protect domestic industries for such a country does not change. As long as the world price remains low, the tariff will not change the situation.

Note: I left the math/equations alone and only fixed typos and merged broken lines. Revenue is redistributed accordingly. Thus, a tariff raises the domestic relative price for consumers, and a tariff wuantitously lowers prices. "In other words, of imports proportionately for such a country and p < 0. Thus, if a 10% ad-valorem tariff imposed on its import-competing industry is always protected at the initial free trade equilibrium, an import tariff lowers the world relative price by more than 10%, the domestic relative price declines, and domestic injustices occur.

Income Distribution: An import tariff redistributes factor incomes within countries. The direction of such charges are determined by two factors: Total differentialing the above equation, (?) how does an import tariff change the Domestic relative price, and

dpd = dpw + t * dpw + pwdt / pd
(i) The nature of the price magnification effect

⇒ pd^ = rw/(1+t) + (t/(1+t))*rw + (t/(1+t))*t

Export Subsidy
For a small imposing country, an import tariff raises the domestic relative price of its imports and the import-competing good. To encourage exports, Government often provides substitutes to their exporters.

Such a subsidy may be, Thus, by PME, pd = (∂(Pc/PT)∂d) (9) for per unit of exports: SPECIFIC/UNIT EXPORT SUBSIDY (%) for per unit value of exports: AD-VALOREM EXPORT SUBSIDY

In either case, the exporter exports up to the volume for which the domestic price exceeds the price redistribution effect generated in its trading abroad by the per unit amount of the subsidy. In this case, there will be no partner because TOT remains unchanged.

In export subsidy makes sales abroad more attractive. For a large imposing country, TOT Worrens for its trading partner, thereby causing changes in a larger proportion of production, which is thus now exported. Earnings are there as well. Thus, creating EXCESS DEMAND in the domestic market and EXCESS SUPPLY in the foreign market.

HC: Î > Pc > PT > W => TOT improves ASYMMETRIC CHANGES IN This increases the relative domestic price of textiles.

FC: $\hat{W} > \hat{P}_T > \hat{P}_C > \hat{\tau}$ => TOT WASSELS FACTOR INCOMES at the initial point. Therefore, the domestic consumers demand less of textiles.

But the price increase encourages the producers to produce more. 

ρd = (1+λ)ρw;
ρi = (∀i=d,w)(ρT/ρc)i

The decline in consumers' surplus is redistributed to part of the state's producers as their surplus. But, the subsidy given is a loss to the economy. Of the total subsidy given, the part measured by the welfare gain is part of producers' surplus and thus is redistribution rather than a loss to the economy. However, the other parts of the subsidy measured by deadweight losses do not constitute gains for someone else in the economy, and hence are losses. For a small home country, the rise in domestic price for an advocate export subsidy and its dead weight losses result in consumption and production losses respectively. Economic effects are as follows. At the world relative price of textiles (Pw), therefore, an export subsidy inflicts a welfare loss on a small open economy. An ad valorem export set subsidy at the rate s, which is a payment to textile producers over and above this world price, raises the domestic relative price of textiles (Pa). Domestic production rises to Pab' and demand falls to Pda'. At Pa, the home country exports a'5' units of textiles. An export subsidy raises the export offer of the (9) quad (9 aa', Pa). represents loss in consumer surplus. In a country, at the initial TOT, this creates an excess supply in the world market for textiles, and (ii) quadrilateral (pw bb'pd) represents gain in producers' surplus. Additionally, (iii) quadrilateral (cd b'a') represents a 70% subsidy. Consequently, this lowers its relative price, or worsens its

Since OMf > OM, this generates a scarcity of computers in the home country, i.e., excess demand. Thus, "c/p" in the home country rises.

* Quota is as if taxing the domestic consumers.
At a rate, t_g = (p^2 - p^10) / t: Quota-Equivalent

Economic Effects of Quotas: Price Equivalence Theorem

(ii) producers are better off

Under perfectly competitive market conditions, if an import quota that allows M amount of imports is replaced by an equal import tariff such that the tariff also generates M amount of imports.
