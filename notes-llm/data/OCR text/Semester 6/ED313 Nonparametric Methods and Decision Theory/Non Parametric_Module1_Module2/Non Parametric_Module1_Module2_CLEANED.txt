The random variable {Xn} has independent and identically distributed uniform distributions on the interval [0,1).

The probability density function f_X(x) is given by:

f_X(x) = 1
f_X(x) = x ∫ dx = x

Properties of Fx(x):

* Fx(x) = 1 - (1-x)
* Fx(n(x)) = 21 = [[24]] - [24] = [24]
* Fxm(x) = ncr x (1-x) n-r (1+x) [(1+x)]

Expected value Ex(x):

Ex(x) = ∫[x^n(1-x)^n-1] dx

= n [(1/h) [(±^η)]^(1/2) - (1/2) [(±^2)]^(1/2)]

The empirical distribution function Sn(x) is the proportion of sample values less than x.

For a given random variable X from the distribution with cumulative distribution function F(x), the empirical distribution function Sn(x) is defined as the proportion of sample values < x.

# Sample Size:

Sn(n) = ∫(0,x) A(x) dx

Theorems 2.3.2 and 2.3.3:
P[lim sup (Sn(x) - Fx(x)) = 0] = 1
<math>\lim_{n\to\infty} P\left\{ \sqrt{n} \left[ \operatorname{Sn}(x) - F_{\times}(n) \right] \leq t \right\} = \phi(t)</math>
