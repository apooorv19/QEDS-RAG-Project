Testing of Hypothesis for Location Parameter.

Let me know if you need any further assistance!

Testing of Hypothesis differs from Estimation in the following way: Based on a random sample of n observations {X1, X2, ... Xn} here the aim is: To estimate M (the central location of the distribution) by Mo, (an estimate) and determine the answer to the following question with certain level of confidence: Does the sample provide strong evidence that M is at the point M0?

Testing of Hypothesis differs from Estimation in the following way: Based on a random sample of n observations {X1, X2, ... Xn} here the aim is: To estimate M (the central location of the distribution) by Mo, (an estimate) and determine the answer to the following question with certain level of confidence: Does the sample provide strong evidence that M is at the point M0? More technically it is written as follows:

The Hypothesis of the form H0: M = M0 is called the Null Hypothesis which is to be accepted or rejected. Acceptance or rejection of H0 is against an alternative Hypothesis H1.

Typical forms of H1 are:

(a) H1: M < M0
(b) H1: M > M0
(c) H1: M ≠ M0

Suppose {X1, X2, ... Xn} is a sample, to test whether Mo is it median. Consider the sample is of size 16 taken from a population. The data consists of the following values: 6.10, 7.80, 10.10, 11.40, 8.65, 2.75, 2.88, 9.95, 6.35, 2.25, 3.95, 5.60, 2.10, 15.45, 13.70, and 8.15.

Test at the 5% level of significance whether the sample is from a population with median 10. Thus H0: M0 = 10 versus H1: M0 < 10.

Two important tests we study in this regard are: 

1) One Sample Sign Test 
2) One Sample Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test. Each test defines its own test statistic based on the sample and has its rule to Accept or Reject the null hypothesis, H0.

One Sample Sign Test

It is one of the simplest of all nonparametric tests. The distribution is assumed to be continuous.

The Procedure

Considers the differences between the observed values Xij and the hypothesized median Mo. The data is converted into a series of (+) and (-) signs according to the sign of Xi - Mo stating whether Xi > Mo or Xi < Mo.

Let N+ = #Xi s.t. Xi > M0 and N- = #Xi s.t. Xi < M0. In case some observations Xi = M0, ignore the zeros and reduce the number of observations accordingly.

Under the null hypothesis (and other assumptions of the sign test), Mo is the unique median of Fχ, hence P(X > M0 | H0) = P(X < M0 | H0) = 0.5. Once the observations are converted as above they constitute a set of N independent random variables from Bernoulli population with probability of success = θ = 1/2. Thus, under the Ho distribution of N+ is Bin(N, 0.5).

If the sample truly comes from a distribution with median Mo, then it is expected that nearly half of the sample observations will be greater than Mo and nearly half of the observations will be less than Mo.

Consider the following situation.

Mo plus signs, i.e. N+ approximately equals N-.
Hence, we tend to accept H0: M equals M0.

But suppose the situation is somewhat like this: i.e., N+ >> N-. Then we feel that M > M0.

But suppose the situation is somewhat like this: M0 + + + + + + + + +. That is, N+ >> N-. Then we feel that M > M0.

Similarly, suppose the situation is somewhat like this: -M0 + + + +. That is, N+ << N-. Then we feel that M << M0.

Thus, we reject H0, in favour of a) H1: M < M0 :: if either N+ is too small or alternatively N- is too big. b) H1: M > M0 :: if either N is too small or alternatively N is too big. (c) H1: M ≠ M0:: if any one of N+ or N- is too big or too small.

Consider the sample of size 16 taken from a population. The data consists of the following values: 6.10, 7.80, 10.10, 11.40, 8.65, 2.75, 2.88, 9.95, 6.35, 2.25, 3.95, 5.60, 2.10, 15.45, and 13.70, with an additional value of 8.15.

Test whether the sample is from a population with median 10.

The null hypothesis is H0: M0 = 10, while the alternative hypothesis is H1: M0 < 10, at a level of significance of 5%.

Therefore N+ and N- are respectively 4 and 12.

Therefore, test statistics S is N+ for this example.
We should check if S is too small.
For checking we consult Binomial Table for Bin(16, 0.5).

Solution

We can use the table from https://faculty.math.illinois.edu/~wkinner2/math124/binom.pdf, which shows the probability of r successes in n independent trials with probability of success p, and then calculate the cumulative frequencies.

p = 0.3518

p = 0.0384
x = 8, n = 1.0000
p = 0.8247
n = 0.6881
x = 9, n = 0.3660 The data appears to be a series of numerical values, likely representing some type of statistical or scientific measurement. The numbers are all between 0 and 1, which suggests that they may represent probabilities or percentages.

It's difficult to determine the exact meaning or context of these numbers without more information. If you could provide additional context or clarify what these numbers represent, I may be able to help further.

For this problem, we shall have to check the cumulative probability of a Binomial (16, 0.5) variable taking a value less than or equal to 4. From the table, we observe that this value is 0.0384, which is the p-value of the test. Hence, the desired probability is <math>< 0.05</math>. Therefore, Ho will be rejected at the 5% level of significance.

Normal Approximation

When n is somewhat large (say above 15), one may approximate the Binomial distribution with a Normal.

Normal Approximation

Since it is a continuous approximation of a discrete distribution, a continuity correction of 0.5 may be incorporated in calculations.

For Bin(n, p) distribution, mean and variance are np and np(1-p), resp. Hence, (3-np)/sqrt(np(1-p)) is approximately N(0, 1).

N+ has a binomial distribution with parameters n and 0.5. We can consider Z = (S - n/2)/sqrt(n/4) to be Normal, and apply Z-test.

Applying continuity correction, the Z-statistic looks as: (S + 1/2 - np)/sqrt(nn(1-n))

For the above problem, Z = (4 + 0.5 - 8) / √(16 * 0.23) = (-3.5) / 2 = -1.75.

Since the cumulative probability of -1.75 is 0.04, we Reject the Null Hypothesis at a 5% level of significance.

One Sample Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test

Please provide the rest of the input, and I'll be happy to help with the cleaning process!

A major problem of the sign test is that it considers all the values greater than M0 with equal importance. For illustration: Suppose we are testing for H0: M0 = 10 on the basis of 5 samples. Consider two sets of observations A = {7, 8, 10, 12, 14} and B = {7, 8, 10, 18, 20}.

A major problem of the sign test is that it considers all values greater than M0 with equal importance. For illustration, suppose we are testing for H0: M0 = 10 on the basis of 5 samples. Consider two sets of observations A = {7, 8, 10, 12, 14} and B = {7, 8, 10, 18, 20}. Then under continuity assumption, A does not seem to reject H0. But it feels intuitive that for B the population median would be greater than 10. The Sign test would give the same output for both. In these situations, we use the concept of Rank Order Statistics.

The Rank Order Statistics for a random sample are any set of constants which indicate the order of the observations. Any statistical procedure based on Rank Order Statistics depends only on relative magnitude of the observations. The test we study now is called One Sample Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test.

One Sample Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test

The test statistic for this test is W, which is calculated as follows:

W = Σ |d_i|

where d_i is the ith signed rank.

The null hypothesis is that the median of the distribution is equal to 0. The alternative hypothesis is that the median is not equal to 0.

The p-value for this test can be obtained using a normal approximation or a permutation test.

Note: This text assumes that the reader has a basic understanding of statistical concepts and notation.

One Sample Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test

We have a random sample of k observations from a continuous distribution with median M. We also make an additional assumption that the distribution is symmetric about the median. We have to test H0: M = Mo against an alternative which can be one-sided or two-sided.

We consider the differences Di = Xi - Mo. Each Di may be positive and negative. We ignore zeros in Di since the probability of zero to occur in a continuous distribution is nil in theory.

We order the absolute differences |D_i| in ascending order and assign them ranks 1, 2, 3, ..., n in increasing order. Let T^+ and T^- denote the sum of ranks of positive differences and the sum of ranks of negative differences, respectively. Ties of rank are distributed equally to both T^+ and T^. Sometimes, in case of tie of ranks, each tied absolute value is assigned the mean of the ranks that would have been allotted in case of no tie. T^+ + T^- = ∑i=1^n i = n(n+1)/2

Under <math>H_0</math>, <math>T^+</math> and <math>T^-</math> should be close. Thus, <math>T^+</math> or <math>T^-</math> serve as an appropriate test statistic depending on the alternative hypothesis.

In contrast to the ordinary one sample sign test, the value of <math>T^+</math>, say, is influenced not only by the number of positive differences but also by their relative magnitudes.

Let T be the smaller of <math>T^+</math> and <math>T^-</math>. If the true population median exceeds <math>M_0</math>, the sample data would reflect this by having most of the larger ranks correspond to positive differences.

Consider the following situation.

Mo ++++++

i.e. T+ ≈ T-

Hence, we tend to accept H0: M = M0

But suppose the situation is somewhat like this: i.e., T+ >> T-. Then we feel that M > M0.

But suppose the situation is somewhat like this: M0 + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +. i.e. T+ >> T- Then we feel that M > M0 Similarly, for a situation like this: M0 + + + i.e. T+ << T- Then we feel that M << M0

If Tα is the number such that P(T ≤ Tα) = α, the appropriate rejection/critical regions for the size α tests of H0: M = M0 corresponding to different alternatives are as follows:

Alternative hypothesis Critical Region Comments
H1: M > M0 Reject H0 if T− is too small T− ≤ Tα Reject H0 if T+ is too small T+ ≤ Tα
H1: M < M0 Reject H0 if T− or T+ is too small
H1: M ≠ M0 T+ ≤ Tα or T− ≤ Tα

Note that: The p-values are calculated using the general definition. For instance, in case of H1: M < M0, if the observed value of T+ is t, then the p-value is P(T+ ≤ t | H0).

Solved Example

Suppose we have the following 20 observations: 9.3, 8.8, 10.7, 11.5, 8.2, 9.7, 10.3, 8.6, 11.3, 10.7, 11.2, 9.0, 9.8, 9.3, 9.9, 10.3, 10.0, 10.1, 9.6, 10.4

We want to test H0: M = 9.9, Against H1: M ≠ 9.9 with significance level α = 0.05

Here, we use updated n = 19, upon ignoring the observation with D_i = 0. T^+ = 99.5 and T^- = 90.5. Thus, the test statistic T = T^- = 90.5. From Wilcoxon critical value table (http://users.stat.ufl.edu/~winner/tables/wilcox signrank.pdf), for this two-sided test for α = 0.05, we have a critical value of 46. Therefore, the rejection region is T^+ ≤ 46 or T^- ≤ 46. According to the observed values, we cannot reject the null hypothesis.

Case 1: Sign Test
Alternatively, if we had taken the test statistic to be N+, then we need to look at Probability Bin(9, 0.5) ≥ 7. This probability is 1 - P(Bin(9, 0.5) ≤ 6) = 1 - 0.9102 = 0.0898. Therefore, we cannot reject the null hypothesis.

Case 1: Sign Test

Hence, the null hypothesis cannot be rejected at a 5% level of significance using the sign test.

Case 2: Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test

Note: There was no original text provided, so I didn't have any typos to fix or broken lines to merge. The output is simply the input with no changes made.

Case 2: Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test

Recollect:

Alternative hypothesis
Critical Region
Comments

H1: M > M0
Reject H0 if T- is too small
T- ≤ Tα
Reject H0 if T+ is too small
H1: M < M0
T+ ≤ Tα
H1: M ≠ M0
Reject H0 if T- or T+ is too small
T+ ≤ Tα or
T- ≤ Tα

Therefore, we compute the statistics as follows:

Therefore, T^+ = 42 and T^- = 3

Therefore, T^+ = 42 and T^- = 3
At the 5% level, the Critical value is 8 and T = 3 < 8

Since the observed value of the statistic T is less than the critical value, we reject H0 at a 5% level of significance using the Wilcoxon signed rank test.

This also shows that the Signed Rank test is more powerful than the Sign Test.

Normal Approximations

Note: Since there was no OCR text provided, I didn't have any text to fix typos or merge broken lines. The output is simply the title "Normal Approximations". If you provide the actual OCR text, I'd be happy to help with cleaning it up!

The formula for normal approximation is as follows. For simplicity, let there be n observations. Assume there are no ties. Then each of the n integer ranks {1,2,...,n} is equally likely to go to T+ and T-. Let Wi be the Bernoulli variable suggesting Xi goes to T+ or T-. So Wi takes 1 and 0 accordingly as Xi goes to T+ and T- respectively. So Wi = {1 if Di > 0; 0 if Di < 0}. Under H0, Di = Xi - M0 are symmetrically distributed about zero (since X is symmetrically distributed about M = M0). Therefore, P(Wi = 1) = P(Wi = 0) = 1/2, therefore E(Wi) = 1/2 & var(Wi) = 1/4.

So, T^+ = ∑i=1^n W_i * rank of |D_i|

E(T^+) = ∑ E(W_i) * rank of |D_i| = 1 * 1/2 + 2 * 1/2 + … + n * 1/2

= 1/2 * n(n+1)/2 = n(n+1)/4

var(T^+) = ∑i=1^n var(W_i) * (rank of |D_i|)^2

= 1^2 * 1/4 + 2^2 * 1/4 + … + n^2 * 1/4

= 1/4 * n(n+1)(2n+1)/6 = n(n+1)(2n+1)/24

Therefore, for larger values of n (say, n > 25), values of which are not available in Wilcoxon signed rank statistic tables, the standard normal distribution can be approximated by N(0,1).
