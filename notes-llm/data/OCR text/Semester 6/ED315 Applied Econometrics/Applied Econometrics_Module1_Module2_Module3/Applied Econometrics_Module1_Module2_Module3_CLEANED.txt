(2.) Measurement of Poverty: Penury Measures in India

Head Count Ratio (HCR): To reach a certain number of individuals, Penerty Gap ratio (PGR) is used.

The poverty gap ratio (PGR) is defined as:

PGR = √(y^2 - p) / y^2

where y represents the average income and p represents the poverty line.

In addition to PGR, another variant is used: Jep (yi-p), which is also known as the Jur measure. This is calculated using the following equation:

JUR = yi - p

Another variant is Sylver (yi-p), which is similar to Jep but uses a different calculation method.

Poverty line is granted in terms of per capita consumption expenditure over a month. The poverty line is calculated based on the distribution of persons obtained from large sample surveys every year of consumption expenditure data from NSSO, using a Westinghouse group of 1962-1970. In a household of five. Revealing poverty line of consumption expenditure should not be less than Rs 100 per month in terms of 1960-61 prices, which is equivalent to Rs 20 per capita per month.

₹125 per month per household in 1960-61 prices. F ₹25 per capita per month. Based on the recommendation of a balanced diet made by the Nutrition Advisory group of ICMR, health and education were excluded - assuming that these would be provided publicly (by the state). According to Daskforce 1979 (Alagh), (a) calculated the poverty line based on the average calorie requirement separately for all India rural and urban samples. Corresponding monetary values are ₹2400 Kcal (R) / ₹2100 Kcal (W) per person. Took into account age, gender, and activity-specific calorific allowances.

Inequality: The distribution of income and consumption among different social classes, with a focus on the middle class.

Inequality: Cumulative share of Income. Gini Coefficient.

Stable inequality exists when a single individual holds 100% of total income.

Share of population:

1. Top 5% earning 40% of total income.
Bottom 95% earning 60% of total income.

Income follows some distribution, which may have a cumulative distribution function (CDF) or probability density function (PDF). Some conclusions can be drawn about it.

Maximum likelihood Estimation (MIE).

The equation for L(α, C) is:

L(α, C) = ∑[n/∑(αc^α)/χj^(α+1)]C(α, C)

where χj represents the jth observation.

This equation can be rewritten as:

L(α, C) = (α^n c^(nα))/((η/(1+1))χ_1^n)^α+1

or

L(α, C) = (α^n c^(nα))/((χ_1, χ_2, ..., χ_n)^α+1)

MIE is different from OLS in that it minimizes the sum of squares of errors, whereas MIE minimizes the joint probability density function.

1) Preference ordering should be complete and transitive.
If x' > x", then x" > x".

Note: The original text had some mathematical equations and symbols that I left unchanged.

4. Preferences over Sets

Let x = (x1, x2) be a point in the plane.

Reflexivity: For all x, xR.

Monotonicity: If A > B, then A > C for all C in preferred set.

Convexity: The set of all possible utility functions is convex.

Mathematically, this can be represented as:

<math>\dim \Delta x \to 0</math>

Griller's Theorem (2nd version):

For any two alternatives A and B, if U(A) + (1-A)U(B) > U(AA+(1-A)B), then all points on the indifference curve are differentiable.

Note: I left the math equations alone as per your instruction.

A function U(.) is a well-defined property.

U(A) = U(B)
if A > B
then U(A) > U(B)

Ordinal welfare and not cardinal wealth

(x1, x2) = U(x1, x2)

Budget set:
P1x1 + P2x2 ≤ M

I assume that the indifference curve is tangent to the budget line at E.

The slope of the indifference curve equals the slope of the budget line.
7 = 0, and 2 = m/P2.

By assumption, λ1 > 0.

L = U(x1, x2) + λ[M - P1x1 - P2x2]

∂L/∂x1 = 0, ∂L/∂x2 = 0, ∂L/∂λ = 0

∂U/∂x1 - λP1 = 0
∂U/∂x2 - λP2 = 0
P1x1 + P2x2 ≤ M

Marshallier DX2

The system of equations is defined as follows:

U = 21, 22
U = U(XINDE)

The Lagrangian L is given by:

L = M1x2 + A[M - P1x1 - p2x2] = 0.

The partial derivatives are:

∂L/∂n1 = n2 - λp1 = 0
= χ1 - λp2 = 0

The relationships between the variables are:

X = M/2p1, X2# = M/2p2
21 = x1 (p1/p2/M)
22 = x (p, M)
12 = x2 (P1, P2, M)
X2 = X2 (P, M)

Vector 2 is defined as:

gncome

The function U* is given by:

U* = u(xi*, x*)

V = U(x, (P, M), x2(P, M))

In direct proportionality, we have:

0* = M/2ρ1 × M/2ρ2
U* = M²

A Study on Income Consumption Curve

M = Spixi XI of their demand for two goods changes. How does demand change?

(1) When the price of one good (X1) increases and the price of another good (X2) remains constant,

Substitution Effect:
When moving from a more expensive good to a cheaper good, there is an initial tendency to substitute the cheaper good for the more expensive one.

Income Effect:
As purchasing power changes due to the change in income, this leads to a change in demand.

Note: I left the math/equations alone as per your instruction.

Marshallian demand: Quene from -1 reflects changes in p, keeping P2 and M unchanged.

Table 1 shows substitution effects (-ve) of income (+ne) on demand change. How demand changes all and all, considering constant citility demand compensated for dd (Cuene). Keeping v constant, MARCO TO THE PROPERTY.
