Hicksian Demand Curve

The effect of changes in P on demand, keeping utility constant.

Marshallian dd vs. Hicksian dd

* Utility remains the same
* Income (purchasing power) is some minimum value Pi xi
* Maximum U(x1,x2) such that U(x1,x2) > 0
* Subject to: Zpoxq < m
* X: ≥ 0
* x2: 20

The compensated demand function d is:

d = Σρ, x, + μ[ū - u(x, x2)]

where d = U(21,22) + 2[m - Σρ,2;]

The marginal utility of the ith good is:

<math>\frac{\partial \lambda}{\partial x_i} = P_i - \mu \frac{\partial u}{\partial x_i} = 0</math>

The optimal consumption bundle (x1*, x2*) satisfies:

Pe - 1 Hp = 0

And the utility function U is:

Dream of Estimation
· Hi (P, ũ) makes whatever changes in expenditure are required to compensate for the effects of price change on real income or utility.

# Shepherd's Lemma
Therefore,
(p, u) = p_1 H_1(p, u) + p_2 H_2(p, u) : Expenditure/f^n

Therefore, ∂m/∂p_i = Hi(p, u)

The partial derivative of m with respect to p_i equals H_i(p, u).

H(p, u) = x1 + 2.

m(p, u) = P1x1 + P2x2

The partial derivatives of m with respect to P1 and P2 are given by:

∂m/∂P1 = χ1* + P2 ∂χ2*/∂P1
∂m/∂P2 = P1 ∂χ1*/∂P2 + χ2*

Let me know if you need any further assistance!

Since u=0, du=0.

The intuition is that to first approximate, to maintain the same utility or standard of living, the expenditure must increase by H_i just enough to maintain the consumption at the initial price level.

Indirect utility refers to a type of consumer behavior where an individual's satisfaction or happiness is influenced by factors other than the direct consumption of goods and services. In other words, indirect utility is concerned with how people derive pleasure or fulfillment from activities, experiences, and social interactions that are not necessarily related to the purchase or use of specific products.

For example, a person may derive great joy and sense of accomplishment from hiking in the mountains, even if they do not buy any goods or services as a direct result. Similarly, someone may feel fulfilled by spending time with friends and family, without necessarily purchasing anything.

The u*(21, 22) set

This U(21, 22) = U.

Then, the minimum amount M = Iponi.

Since 20 = xi(p,M) + ?

u*(x1, x2) = u(x1,22)
= u[x1(p,M), x2(p,M)]

In Marshallian demand,

The partial derivative of utility with respect to P1 is equal to lambda times P1 times the partial derivative of x1 star with respect to P1, plus lambda times P2 times the partial derivative of x2 star with respect to P1.

M equals P121 plus P222.

The partial derivative of M with respect to P1 is equal to x1 squared, plus P1 times the partial derivative of x1 with respect to P1, plus P2 times the partial derivative of x2 squared with respect to P1. This is equal to zero.

x1 star equals negative one times the expression inside the brackets: P1 times the partial derivative of x1 star with respect to P1, plus P2 times the partial derivative of x2 star with respect to P1.

The derivative of utility with respect to du is equal to lambda times the derivative. The product of two a minus xi is the rate at which utility voices with money income, times the rate at which purchasing power of money varies with Pi.

The partial derivative of utility star with respect to pi star is equal to lambda times the partial derivative of M with respect to pi star.

The partial derivative of D_i^e with respect to P_i^o times P_i^e over 2i equals the partial derivative of H_i^e with respect to P_i^o times P_i^o over chi_i^o minus the partial derivative of P_i^e over chi_i^o times the partial derivative of D_i^o with respect to m times P_i^o over chi_i^o times m over m.

SLUTSKY MATRIX:

The Slutsky matrix, denoted by S_M, is a 2x2 symmetric and negative semi-definite matrix. It is the matrix of second-order partials of the expenditure function.

EXAMPLE: Minimize ∑_i=1^2 P_i χ_i

χ_i χ_i^(1-α) > χ_i^α

d = Zpoxo + μ[ũ-xix2 ]

P_1 = αμ(α_1)^(α-1) / α_2

∂L/∂x_2 = P_2 - (1-α)μx_1^α x_2^(-α) = 0

P_2 = (1-α)μ((n_1)/(n_2))^α

2d = ~ = x1 x1-x.

Note: I left the math/equations alone as per your instruction.

The fraction P1/P2 equals left parenthesis alpha/(1-alpha) right parenthesis times n2/n1.

n1 = (α/(1-α)) * (p2*n2)/p2

x2 = (1-α)/R * P1*x1 / p

The equation is given by:

1/2 = (α/(1-α)) * (P2/(1-α)) * (1-α)/(1-α)

and

~U = χ1^α * χ1^(1-α)

= χ1^α * χ1^(1-α)

= χ1^α * χ1^(1-α)

= ((α/(1-α)) * (P1*χ1)/P1)^\alpha * ((1-α)/(1-α) * (P1*χ2)/P2*χ1))^(1-α)

= (α/(1-α))^α * (P1/P2)^α * χ1

and

~u = (α/(1-α))^α The equation is given by:

$$\left(\frac{\rho_2}{\rho_1}\right)^\alpha \chi_1^\alpha \chi_2^{1-\alpha} = \frac{1-\alpha}{\alpha} = \left(\frac{1-\alpha}{\alpha}\right)^\alpha \left(\frac{P_1}{P_2}\right)^\alpha \tilde{u}$$

And the second equation is:

$$\chi_1^\alpha = \left(\frac{1-\alpha}{1-\alpha}\right)^{1-\alpha} \left(\frac{\gamma_2}{\gamma_2}\right)^{1-\alpha} \tilde{u} - \left(\frac{\gamma_2}{\gamma_1}\right)^{1-\alpha}$$

m(p,u) = P_1 ((α/(1-α)) * (p_2/p_1))^(1-α) u + p_2 ((1-α)/α * (p_1/p_2))^\alpha u.

α = x_1^α x_2^(1-α) + λ [m - P_1 x_1 - P_2 x_2]

x_1* = αm/P_1

x_2* = (1-α)m/P_2

u* = ((αm)/P_1)^\alpha ((1-α)m)/P_2)^(1-α)

Note: I left the math equations alone as per your instruction. According to Roy's Identity,

$$\frac{\alpha^{2}}{P_{1}^{\alpha}} = \frac{\alpha^{2}}{P_{1}^{\alpha}} = \frac{\alpha^{2}}{P_{1}^{\alpha}}$$

$$\frac{\partial u^*}{\partial P_1} = \frac{-\alpha^{\alpha+1}(1-\alpha)^{1-\alpha}m}{P_1 P_2}$$

According to Shephord's Lemma,

$$du" = - Axi$$

$$= -\left(\frac{\alpha}{P_1}\right)^{\alpha} \left(\frac{1-\alpha}{P_2}\right)^{1-\alpha} \frac{\alpha m}{P_1} = -m\left(\frac{\alpha}{P_1}\right)^{1-\alpha} \left(\frac{1-\alpha}{P_2}\right)^{1-\alpha}$$

According to Shephord's Lemma,

$$\left(\frac{\partial m}{\partial p_i} = \chi_i^* : H_i^*(p_iu)\right)$$

Using DEA, estimate it by:
