Folk Theorem:
It is possible to support cooperation in a repeated Prisoner's Pilemma and similar non-one-shot equilibria outcomes in infinitely repeated games with sufficiently high discount factors.

Tix for Tat Strategy:

Promise-Promise
Breakdown:
The length of the punishment depends on the behavior of the player who is being punished.
If P2 deviates to defect, then P will start choosing Ci.
If Pr reverts back to good behavior, then I will also revert back to Promise.

When p. plays M in stage 1, it checks whether P2 chooses M or F.
If MM' is played, P. will play R' in the second period (he is assured about P2's behavior).
If 'MM' is not played, Pr. is shifted to 'F', which seems more attractive (5 > 4), and then provides play F' in the second stage with (1, 1) being achieved later than (3, 3). (F.F.)

Coalition and Core, Module 4

When a group of players coordinate with each other's strategies and come together, they form a coalition. When one member of a coalition makes a grand gesture to another member of the same coalition, it can lead to a more derived outcome for the coalition: side payment.

Core: Consists of all the coalition structures that are stable. This happens when members of any coalition can improve their payoffs/utility/return by dropping out of one coalition and joining another.

Coalition Games

1. Non-Transferable
2. Transferable Utility Games

Where players can transfer their utilities freely, dividing the total utility.

N = {1, 2, ..., N} - Grand Coalition (Grand)
C = Coalitions/Partitions possible: C = N

V: Characteristic/Value (worth); V(c)

Consider ({1,23} {33}) V/5 ({11, {2,31}}) V/5

Outcome of Game: G(N,V)

G(N,V) is given by (J,x) where

1) J = 5 C1, C2, ..., CM such that ∩C_i = N; Ci ⊆ N
* Cincj = 0 (payoff vector)

χ = {χ_1, χ_2, ..., χ_N} ∈ ℝ^N

To solve a coal game:

1) Feasibility Principle: Existence = Value per ton > The sum of payoffs of all members of a part coal has to be equal to the value of that coal?

2) Individual Rationality Principle: No one should participate if V(i) ≤ 0. The value of payoff of an individual should not be less than the worth of the coal where he is alone. Otherwise, players have every incentive to devour some existing coal and enjoy it alone.

M-5: Auctions :-
The Game Theoretic Auction Model is a mathematical game that aims to maximize the value of an object, considering the abilities and willingness of multiple bidders competing and submitting bids.

The mechanism of this game depends on how the bids interact. Here are some types of auctions:

1. Dutch auction (descending price auction): Bids are submitted simultaneously, and the highest bid wins. The buyer pays the highest bid price.
2. Scaled bid auction: Bids are submitted simultaneously, and the highest bid wins. The buyer pays the highest bid price minus a small increment.
3. First Price Auction: The highest bidder wins, and they pay the highest bid price.
4. Second Price Auction: The highest bidder wins, and they pay the second-highest bid price.
5. All Pay Auction: Each participant pays what they bid.

Note: Silent bidding is not explicitly mentioned in the original text, but it is a common type of auction mechanism where bidders submit their bids without revealing them to others until the end of the auction.

Second Price Scaled Bid Auctions:

Bidders win, but pay not their bid, but in highest bid!
