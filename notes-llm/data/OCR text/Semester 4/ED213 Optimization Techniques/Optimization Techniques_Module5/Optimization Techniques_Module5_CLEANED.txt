Dynamic Programming: Shortest Path Problem

The node/city where Deuson lies (n=2) has to move one stage to go. The state of the system, we try to make the best decision at that stage to go.

Given that the optimal decision (optimal dance) F*(8) is to move to X, which is a State variable - 5XG.

The problem is to decide where one should go more stages to go out. The decision variable for this problem is H.

One stage to go, the state of the system is:

* n=1 => optimal decision
* (dis dance) F.*(8)
* XI: state variable - XzI

More stages to go, the state of the system is:

* 17/6
* 14
* 14
* I: 16
* H: 13
* G: 13

Stage: The point at which a decision is made

State | Decision Variable: The variables that link the state of a system to its decision-making process are known as decision variables.

Two stages.

3) Optimal Policy / Criteria of Effectiveness:

man/min

y) Bellman's Principle of Optimality: An optimal policy has a property that whatever the initial state and decision are, the remaining decisions must constitute an optimal solution with regard to the resulting state and policy.
