Date: Page Assignment Problem

Given: resources (facilities), activities (jobs), and effectiveness (in terms of cost, profit, time).

The problem is assigning each activity to only one resource so that the only one activity of optimized.

In tabular form:

Activities | Supply | Job | Resources | Job Time | Cost
---------|--------|-----|----------|---------|-----
1        | 3      | C21 | 1         | 4776    |
2        | 1      | C22 | 1         | 128     |
3        | 49     | N   | 44        | 100     |

Objective: to assign a facility (i) with a facility is assigned and involved.

With 13546 resources, the problem involves assigning 100 activities to facilities.

Step-2: (Opportunity Cost Matrix):-
a) Identify the smallest element in each row?

Then subtract it for each element of that you then
Step-3:-
a) Identify rows successively from top to bottom until a row with exactly one year is found. Make no assignment to that single zero by making a square (11) around it and cross out all the rows in the corresponding column.
b) Then, repeat for each column (left to right).
b) If a row and/or column has more than one unmarked zeroes, then choose the zero cell arbitrarily for assignment.

Step 41: Optimality

a) It appears that all elements are either with crossed out (x) or there is exactly one assignment in each row and column. Then it is optimal.

It's a quiet moment in a now and column.

b) When assignments were chosen auditorily, then exists an atternable sum.

c) If there is no assignment in a row/column, men go to Step 5.

Steps: [Revise the Opportunity Cost Matrix]

a) For each row in which no assignment was made, mark V.

b) Examine the marked row. If any now zero-element occurs in that row, mark V to the respective column.

c) Examine the marked column. If any assigned zero element occurs in that column, mark it to the respective rows containing those assigned zero elements.

d) Repeat the process until no more rows/columns can be marked.

Step 2:
b) Subtract ide ingalls hot any line
to every element in the cells which are covered by a line.

Suppose we have one salesman, who has to visit n cities. Starting from the city A.

An attorney visiting all cities once he has to return to his initial city. The problem is to find a path so that the travelling cost/time/distance is minimized.

In addition to the assignment problem, it has some additional conditions:

• We cannot visit one city twice except for the starting city.
• Visiting city x to x is not allowed.
• Starting and ending cities are the same.
• If he visits city i to j directly, Xij = 0; otherwise, IPP: min. ∑(i=1 to n) ∑(j=1 to n) Cij χij

i) Interval Halving Method
ii) Fibonacci Method

Consider min f(n) in [a, b]

n ∈ ℝ

Interval-halving Method 1:

If a function is given to be unimodal in a given range, the interval (interval of uncertainty) in which the minimum lies can be known at two points in the given range.

Let the initial interval of uncertainty be [0, 100].

Step 1: Divide the interval into two equal parts, and label the middle part as x₀ and the quarter interval points as x₁ and x₂. Obtain f(x₀), f(x₁), and f(x₂).

Step 2:

|  |
| x₀ |  |
| x₁ | 0.5 |
| x₂ |

(a) If f(x₁) > f(x₀) > f(x₂), delete [x₀, x₂].

(b) If f(x₁) < f(x₀) < f(x₂), delete [x₀, x₁].

The finite differences are calculated as follows:

fo = 0.5 (0.5 - 1.5) = 0.5 (-1) = -0.5000
Fint = 0.25 (0.25 - 1.5) = 0.25 (-1.25) = 0.3125

and the will be calculated as follows:

f2 = 0.75 (0.75-1.5) = 0.75 (-0.75) = -0.5625
