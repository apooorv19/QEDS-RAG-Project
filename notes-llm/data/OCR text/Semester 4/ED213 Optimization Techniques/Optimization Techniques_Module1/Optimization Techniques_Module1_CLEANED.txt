Introduction to Optimization Problem

FORMATION OF LPP:
R. Food 'X' contains 6 units of vitamin A and 7 units of vitamin B per gram, and costs $12 per gram.
Food 'Y' contains 8 units of vitamin A and 12 units of vitamin B per gram, and costs ₹20 per gram.

The daily requirement of vitamin A and vitamin B is at least 100 units and 120 units, respectively.

Formulate the above problem as a Linear Programming Problem (LPP) to minimize the cost.
Let x1 be the number of units of Food 'X' and x2 be the number of units of Food 'Y'.

Total amount of Vitamin A = 6x1 + 8x2
Total amount of Vitamin B = 7x1 + 12x2
Total cost = $12x1 + ₹20x2

Constraints:
6x1 + 8x2 ≥ 100
21x1 + 22x2 ≥ 0 (non-negativity constraint)

Constraint: 7x1 + 12x2 > 120

LPP:
minimize
Z = 12x1 + 20x2,
subject to
6x1 + 8x2 > 100
7x1 + 12x2 > 120
x1, x2 ≥ 0
Right from manufacturers, three products A, B, and C.

The prophets are $2, $3, and $4 respectively for each unit of product. The form has two machines required machine time (minutes) on each product is given below. X + Y have 2000 and 3000 minutes respectively.

Let me know if you need any further assistance!

X = 43

The form produces 100 A's, 200 B's and 50 C's,
but not more than 150 A's. Set up an equation to represent this situation.

Let me know if you need any further assistance!

Maximize Profit

(Note: I fixed the typo "maxenize" to "maximize", and merged the broken lines into a single sentence.)

Let there be x1, write of A, 22 units of B and zz unit of C.
Total profit = 2x1 + 3x2 + 4x3
Machine minutes for AX = 4x1+3x2+5x3 & 2000
Machine minutes for Y = 221+2x2+4x3 (3000

Constraints:
4x1+3x2+5x3 < 2000
221+2x2+4x3 < 3000
100 ≤ x ≤ 5200, 150
0 ≤ 2 < 200
0 ≤ x < 23 < 50

2x1+2x2+4x3 ≤ 3000
100 ≤ x ≤ 5150
0 ≤ x ≤ 22, 2 ≤ 200

A general LPP is given by,

# FEASIBLE SOLUTION
The points X are said to be feasible solutions of the problem if XF satisfies all the inequalities and equalities with the non-negative constraints.

# OPTIMAL SOLUTION
A feasible solution X is said to be optimal if Z(X*) < Z(XF) for minimization, or Z(X*) > Z(XF) for maximization.
An Linear Programming Problem (LPP) can hence have:
a) a unique solution.
b) an infinite number of solutions.
c) an unbounded solution.
d) no solution.

Step 2: Use the trial-and-error method to find a consistent solution that gives an extreme value.

For an optimal solution, the optimal solution exists at the corner points only.

λ1 + λ2 + … + λn = 1.

A convex combination.

A set X is said to be a convex set if for every any two points (x1, x2) in X, the line segment joining these two points lies entirely within the set.

For a convex set, a convex combination of any two points lies in the set. 

Example: If 0 < λ2 < 1 and λ1 + (1 - λ)κ1 ∈ X; then X is a convex set.

Theorem: A hyperplane is a convex set.

X = {x : Cx = Z}

Proof:
Let x1, x2 ∈ X ⇒ Ct x1 = Z + Ct x2 = Z
x3 = λx2 + (1 - λ)x1; 0 ≤ λ ≤ 1.
Ct χ3 = Ct [λχ2 + (1 - λ)χ1]
= λ(Ctx2) + (1-λ)(Ct x1)
= Ct x3 = λZ + (1-λ)Z = Z.
∴ χ3 ∈ X : Linear combination of χ1 and χ2; χ1, χ2 ∈ X.

Therefore, X is a convex set.

Theorem: An intersection of two convex sets is also a convex set.

Theorem: The set of all convex combinations of a finite number of points is a convex set.

M CONVEX HULL

A set of all the convex points that constitute a combination of the set of points in X constitutes a convex hull.

X = {(x1, x2): x1 + x2 = 1}
C(X) : Circular region of points: Convex Polyhedron.
Exactly (n+1) vertices is called a 'Simplex'.
A Point is called a 'Simplen' of 1 dimension.
A Line is called a 'Simplen' of 2 dimensions, also known as a Triangle.
A 3-dimensional 'Simplen' is called a Tetrahedron.

STANDARD FORM OF AN LPP

(i) All the constraints except the non-negatively constraint will be in the form of egns.

(ii) The RHS element of each constraint is non-negative.

(iii) All the variables x1, x2, ..., xn are greater than 0.
