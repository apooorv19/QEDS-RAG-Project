Poisson Process: It is one of the most widely used processes for modeling the times at which renewals happen or arrivals enter a system. Recall the renewal process defined by Equation 5, Sn = Σχi^i; S0 = 0 (d).

Total time sequence for n-renewals:

For any renewal process, define N(t) = # renewals up to time t; it is called the counting process and N(t), t > 0.

Note that {Sn > t} is equivalent to {N(t) < n}. Also, note that in a renewal process, the sequence of inter-arrival times: {Xn} is a sequence of iid (independent and identically distributed) variables.

M = 10 TT
Site.

Date: A Poisson process is a renewal process in which the interarrival times {Xn} have an exponential distribution, i.e., for some λ > 0, each Xi has the density:

t_X(x) = λe^(-λx), x > 0

I is the rate of the process, also called the arrival rate of the process.

Memoryless property:
What makes the Poisson Process unique?
P[x > t + x | x > t] = P[x > x]
1 ≤ t < x
Given that renewal has not occurred by time t, the probability distribution of remaining varying time (LHS) is same as the probability of original waiting time (RHS)
This means the remaining waiting time has no meaning of previous waiting.

Theorem: For a Poisson process of rate any given t, t > 0, the length of time until arrival after t is a non-negative random variable with density function d.t. = 1 - e^(-t) ≥ 0.

Non-Homogeneous Poisson Process

In a Poisson process, the arrival state measures the rate of occurrence of an event under consideration. In many situations, this rate may not be constant but vary with time.

A counting process {N(x), x > 0} is defined by the following conditions:

(i) {N(t)} has independent increments.
(ii) P[N(t, t+h) = 1] = λ(t)h + o(h)
(iii) P[N(t, t+n) = 0] = 1 - λ(t)h + o(n)
(iv) P[N(t, t+n) > 2] = o(h)

P[N(u,t)=n] = e^(-Λ(u,t))

x(u,t)
Λ(u,t) = ∫ λ(n) dn
it 1(n) = 1 + x men 1(u,t) = 1(t-u)

Non-Homogeneous Poisson Process: S(n) = $\frac{\lambda}{21}$ homogeneous

N(t) ~ Pois(xt)

N(f, 4)
{N(t), t > 0}

This process has independent increments.
