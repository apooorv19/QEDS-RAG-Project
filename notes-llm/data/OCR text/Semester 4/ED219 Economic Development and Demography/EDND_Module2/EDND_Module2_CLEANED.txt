AK MODEL

Yi = AKi (Si Ni) 1-4
S: Index of SKILLS Or Knowledge available to the team.
Learning by doing through Investment.

Kit Sit
Each team's knowledge is a public good that teams can acquire at zero cost.
2. New Technology can be easily duplicated.

Si = K (Assumption)
Yi = AKi (K Ni) 1-4

The Solow Model:
Avg. Product of Capital

Mathematical Representation:

y / k = A (decreasing)

Note: I left the math equations and formulas as they were, following your instruction to "LEAVE MATH/EQUATIONS ALONE".

Run Economic Growth is desired by technological progress - A.

Neo-classical models suggest that the engine of growth is determined within the system, endogenously. This means that economic growth is driven to create technological knowledge and human capital.

Acquisition of skills is related to Mechanism Z Education. Why is it important? People can move out of low-paying jobs.

Endogenous Growth Model: -

R&D, a source of growth through innovation; endogenous.

Two institutions that help in managing and creating knowledge are:

Labour capital goods production sector. Knowledge created.

Threats to this sector include:

New knowledge output savings consumption ¥ . of L (1-8)

By doing the following:

Learning by doing: once knowledge is created, it becomes a public good.

Note: I left the math/equations alone as per your instruction.

Leaving by doing: Each person's investment in Knowledge & productivity grows some from investments.

Is sufficiently small, and its own effect of increased capital intensity (ki)

"Rocital intensity (K) is each from contribution to the average capital intensity (K). MARGINAL: it takes K as given, PC of P/A. J = A*K^9. So how > K."

Growth Rate of Capital Stock:

K = 3d - (n+8)
PC Investment = dK = sy-(n+s)

k = SA - (n+8) > 0
CAR 1
Capital stock per capita grows at steady state rate [SA - (n+s)]
(n+8) > K
