Under-Development > Low-Income Measurement issues and Compliance

Subsistence Consumption -> presence of non-marketed goods

Basket of goods > Prices do not reflect the true preferences of people. Non-traded goods > not reflected in PPP

Structural Features of Developing Countries:

• High birth rate and high death rate
Dependence on agriculture/primary sector
Urbanization
Lees
Rural-urban migration
Large internal/unorganized sector.

Composition of trade: dominated by primary industries.

Products.

• Imports: Manufactured Products.
* Low Per Capita Energy Consumption.

(Human Development Index)

HDI is a summary measure of average achievement in key dimensions of human development, including a long and healthy life.

Being knowledgeable.

Having a decent standard of living.

Mathematical representation:

The Golden Rule of Consumption & Savings: -

Its per-capita capital should keep increasing to a steady state per capita capital.

SAK = n + 8

Is steady per-capita output?

Increase your future rate by increasing savings and consumption, not expense. Y > 2-

Intertemporal Choice: -

Two periods: 4 = 1, 2
u = 4 (C, C2)
pd. 1: C > Cons.
in Pd. 2: in C2 -> Impatient Consumer

Note: I left the math/equations alone as per your instruction.

Parent Consumer

Man utility equals utility of consumption, denoted by W. This can be written as:

W = C + CZ
where C is the consumer's wealth and Z is a random variable representing uncertainty.

The following equation represents the optimal allocation of resources:

<math display="block">\frac{C_1 + C_2}{1+\gamma} = \frac{y_1 + \frac{y_2}{2}}{1+\gamma}</math>

This equation states that the ratio of consumption to wealth is equal to the ratio of income to wealth. The variables C1 and C2 represent different types of consumption, while y1 and y2 represent different sources of income.

The Golden Rule states:

C' = (1-8) y 1
where C' is the consumer's optimal level of consumption.

In steady state, the following equation holds:

SAKT = (n+5)K

This equation represents the relationship between savings and wealth. The variables SAKT and K represent savings and wealth, respectively.

The following equation represents the change in consumption with respect to changes in savings:

<math display="block">\frac{\Delta C}{\Delta S} = \left[ \alpha A K^{-1} - (N+S) \right] \frac{\Delta K}{\Delta S}</math>

This equation shows that the change in consumption is proportional to the change in savings, with a proportionality constant that depends on the consumer's wealth and the level of uncertainty.

Finally, the following equations represent the optimal allocation of resources:

8 Gold = Savings Rate Required to Sustain the Golden Rule of Steady State Consumption

The rule sustains the general consumption of capital stock, Cgold, which minimizes the constant that is employed by members of each current and future generation.

Pushing to increase savings beyond a certain point because one heeds the pay-off to set an output to replace depreciated capital with more capital each increment in capital stock.

Diminishing Incremental Output and increasing requirements too depreciated capital leaves a net incremental output replaced, which is available for constant that is decreasing.
