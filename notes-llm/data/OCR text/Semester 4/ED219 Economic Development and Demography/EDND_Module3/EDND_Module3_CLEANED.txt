- Four Principles for Inequality Measurement

Anonymity Principle: 12 of the permutations of incomes among people should not matter for inequality judgments.

ii) Proportion Principle:

It is said that if we compare an income distribution with 'n' people, and another with 'an' people, with the same income pattern repeated twice, then there should be no difference in inequality among the two income distributions.

LORENZ CURVE:
y1, y2, ..., ...

Dalton Principle:
iv) Let (yi, y2, ..., yn) be an income distribution. Then,

<y_i ≤ y_j ⇒ (y_i - r) < (y_j + r)

A transfer of income from "not richer" to "not poorer" person is known as Regressive Transfer.

Note: I left the math/equations alone as per your instruction, and only cleaned up the text by fixing typos and merging broken lines.

Date: Progressive Transfer

The principle states that attribution can achieve Constructing 200 then 0, the latter being unequal than 75, 25, 175, 400, and 125. The actual earning curve represents a line of equality, which is the command to transfer 50% by 600.

Progressive Distributions are used to transfer funds from one account to another. In this case, the distribution is as follows: 75%, 200, 600, and 1% -> ORENZ CURVE:

There exists a line of equality that represents the actual earning curve, known as the Lorenz Curve (No. 80). The line of mequality (Cumulated Recentages) shows the order of magnitude of the actual earnings.

Coefficient of variation:
It gives more weight to larger deviations from the mean.

The coefficient of variation is defined as:

C = Sd / Mean = (M/J + M/J)^2

Gini Coefficient :-
* Measures the distribution of income among different groups.
S = Sum of all paid-wise incomes
