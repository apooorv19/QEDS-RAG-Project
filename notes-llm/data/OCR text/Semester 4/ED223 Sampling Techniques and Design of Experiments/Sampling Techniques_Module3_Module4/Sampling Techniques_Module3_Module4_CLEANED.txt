Strata ENi = N
Sample Zn; = n
Vstrat < VSRS

For a stratum h, No = total number of units or individuals in the stratum h.
Ng = total number of units in a sample drawn from non-stratum.
This value is obtained from one unit in the stratum.

Wh = Mh = Stratum weight.
The = mh = sampling proportion in the ith stratum
Vn = (Nh / Nh) = true mean of the ith stratum.
The sample mean.

S_h = (N_h) / (∑(J_n - J_n)^2) = true variance of

N_h-1 = N_h / N_h-1 = N_h / N_h = ...

1/√3 = 1/√3 (N_h). 1/√3 = 1/√3 1/√3 1/√3 1/√3

The estimate Jet is not in general the same as sample mean.

y > n, yn

In §8t, the estimates from ind Stratum seceive the true weights N_h . So,
y coincides with yst provided,
(N_h ± N_h) / N or (n_h) / Nh = (n) / N = t

Theorem 1:
In every stratum, the sample estimate is unbiased for yyn, the just and unbiased estimate for population mean y.
Proof:
E[yst] = E(Σ(yi/2)) = E(Whe) (Jh)
= ∫∫∫
> E(Jst) = J̄

Theorem 2:
If samples are drawn independently in different strata, then

V(Js) = ∫ Wh V(jh) where V(In) is variance of I over repeated samples from Stratity.

Proof 1-
Since Jet = E Wy Jh is a linear combination of Ih with tired weights; hence
V(Jst) = Var (∫ Whyn)
= Σ^2_h (Var(h) + 2 Σ^2_h ω_h Cov(h, j)

Since samples are drawn independently by,
V(¯y_st) = Σ^2_h Var(¯y_h)

MODULE 3.1 - CLUSTER SAMPLING

Before going to field, always calculate in advance.

Notations:

* SSU: Secondary Sampling Units
(i) One-Stage Cluster Sampling:
	+ N = total number of clusters in the population
	+ n = number of clusters to be selected in the first stage.
(ii) Two-Stage Cluster Sampling:
* Jij = measurement for jth element in jth cluster [PSU]
* U = universe = population

CASE: 1 - One Stage Cluster Sampling with equal cluster size.

Mi = mi = M
Estimate income in a 2-person household in this area!
PSU = Household
SSO = Individual
· dij = income of individual within a household
· ti = total income for household i
M=2

To estimate total income, we can use the estimate ±i = N/N (∑i=1 to N) ±i. I is an unbiased estimator of t.

Since we have a simple random sample of 'n' units from a population of 'N' units,

Var(t) = Var(N E ti)
⇒ Var(t) = N^2/n^2 Var(Σz_1t_1)

Let me know if you need any further assistance!

Var(t) = N^2 × K (N-n/Nn) × S^2

Var(+) = N^2 × (N-n) × S^2

S.E. (x) = 1/x = 1/x = 1/x × 1/x = 1/x × 1/x

= N × (1-1/8)^2 - from SRS
To estimate y, y = t

V_{αγ}(\hat{y}) = (N-n/Nn) × (S_/M^2)

S.E. (\hat{y}) = √Var(\hat{y}) = 1/M × √(N-in/Nin) × S_1^2

Systematic Sampling as a special case of Cluster Sampling

Suppose there are 12 units in the population, labeled 1, 2, ..., 12.

N = 3
K = N/n = 12/3 = 4

The clusters are: {1, 5, 9}, {2, 6, 10}, {3, 7, 11}, {4, 8, 12}

One Stage:
N = number of clusters = 4
n = 1 cluster to be selected

In Cluster Sampling,
E(ˆg) = ˆy

There are N = 4 clusters, each with M = 3 units.

V(J545) = Van = 81 (duster)

5 NM units = V_s(ˆy_sys) = 1/M^2 ((N-1)/N) s^2

Ratio Estimator:

Suppose x is an auxiliary variable closely related to y. Y represents Income; Sex-Ratio, and y = Ey; x = Ex.

Then R = y, and R → Ratio Estimator. Using this ratio, we can estimate Y as RX.

<math display="block">
\frac{1}{3} = \hat{x} \times \frac{1}{7} | \text{pop}^n \text{ mean has to be known} |
</math>

The ratio estimator at 7 is:

<math display="block">
\frac{1}{3} = \left(\frac{y}{n}\right) \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{3}
</math>

This is a biased estimator of J. The bias is negligible for a large sample size.
