Module 2: SIMPLE RANDOM SAMPLING

SRS has two parts:

(i) SRS Without Replacement (SRSWOR)
(ii) SRS With Replacement (SRSWR)

Population Variance:
0 = 1(S - 8)^2
5^2 = 1/(N-1) * 1/2 * 1/2 : Population mean square

Sample Variance:
12 = 1 [(y - y)^2

SRSWOR: N = n
SRSWR: N

THEOREM: The sample mean y is an unbiased estimator of population mean Y. Equally, it can be proven that E(y) = Y.

PROOF:

y = y1 + y2 + … + yn
E(¯y) = E((y1 + y2 + … + yn)/n)

E(y) = 71 + 92 + … + FreNCnNCn7.43

= (Σi=1^n ((y1 + y2 + … + yn)/n)) / n

-- (1)
Z(y1+y2+…+yn) = Cn-1 (y1+y2+…+yn) = (N-1)! \ (N-n)! (n-1)!

Note: I left the math/equations alone as per your instruction. (N-1)! = ? y: = (N-x)!(n-1)! NCn NI CA-KIT n! -) E(y): x = 1

Q: Those are 4 people with scores 2, 3, and 105. Derive a sample statistic SRSWOR of n=2, and show that E(y) = Y.

N=4, n=2
Total number of samples selected = 4C2 = 6.

E(ȳr) = (1/Ncn) ∑i=1r ȳi = (1/6) (∑i=1r 16.5) = 2.75

Y = 2 + 3 + 1 + 5 = 11 = 2.75

THEOREM:

The variance of a sample mean (y) is given by:

Var(y) = E(y-y)^2 = N-n/52

Sampling ratio (SRSWOR):

f = S^2/N (1-f)

f = n/N, which is called the sampling fraction.

Variance of the sample mean (SRSWR):

Var(¯g) = E(¯g - ¯γ)^2 = σ^2/n = ((N-1)s^2)/nN

The following table shows the calculation of S^2:

| y | (y+7)^2 |
| --- | --- |
| 2 | (2-2.75)^2 = 0.5 |
| 3 | (3-2.75)^2 = 1.25 |
| 1 | (1-2.75)^2 = 4.5625 |
|  | S^2 = Σ(y+7)^2/n = 8.75 |

The variance of the sample mean is:

Var(¯y) = (4-2)/2*4 * 2.92 = 0.7292

In case of a finite population, we use the factor (N-n) for variance, which is called the finite population correction factor (FPC). For the standard error of the mean (S.E.(\bar{g})), we multiply the expression by the population standard deviation.

Finite Population:
The variance (var(y)) is equal to:

( N - n ) / N ) * σ^2 / n

Note: The math equations remain unchanged as per instruction #3.
