Conceptions of population, sample, survey, and census:

Population: A population refers to a group of individuals who share common characteristics such as geographic location, language, culture, or other defining features.

Sample: A sample is a subset of a larger population that is selected for study. Samples are used in surveys and other research methods to make inferences about the larger population.

Survey: A survey is a method of collecting data from a sample of individuals or organizations. Surveys can be conducted using various methods, including questionnaires, interviews, and observations.

Sample Surveys: Sample surveys involve collecting data from a subset of a larger population. This approach helps to reduce costs and increase efficiency in data collection.

Census/Complete Enumeration: A census is a comprehensive survey that aims to gather information about every member of a defined population. Complete enumeration involves counting every individual within the population, often using a systematic or random sampling method.

Sample Surveys

A sample survey is a method for collecting data from or about the members of a population so that inferences about the entire population can be obtained from a subset, or sample, of the population members (R.L. Williams, in Encyclopedia of Health Economics, 2014).

A properly conducted sample survey will support inference from the sample that is scientifically valid about the population.

Greater Scope, Greater Accuracy

Only resort to studying phenomena that do not involve destroying the items.

Disadvantages of Sample Surveys over Complete Enumeration

Subpopulation estimates may not be reliable. Small geographic areas may not be represented properly. The estimates may contain sampling error, as the data are obtained and processed from a part of the population.

Organization of Fieldwork

The organization of fieldwork involves several key elements, including planning, coordination, and execution. The following are some general guidelines for organizing a successful fieldwork project:

* Define the purpose and scope of the project: Clearly articulate the goals and objectives of the project to ensure everyone involved is on the same page.
* Identify the team members: Determine who will be responsible for different aspects of the project, such as data collection, equipment maintenance, and logistics.
* Plan the fieldwork schedule: Develop a detailed timeline for the project, including dates, times, and locations.
* Coordinate with stakeholders: Communicate with relevant parties, such as landowners, regulatory agencies, and other researchers, to ensure that all necessary permissions and approvals are obtained.
* Prepare equipment and materials: Ensure that all necessary tools, instruments, and supplies are available and in good working order.
* Execute the fieldwork plan: Carry out the planned activities according to schedule, taking into account any unexpected challenges or changes.

By following these guidelines, you can help ensure a successful and productive fieldwork experience.

Probability Sampling

• Probability sampling is the mechanism through which inferences are extended from the sample to the population. A probability sampling plan associates a nonzero probability of selection with each and every member of the survey population, such that the selection probability can be determined for every member of the sample.
• A random process is used to select the sample so that the desired probabilities of selection are achieved.

Common Probability Sampling Methods

Simple Random Sampling: A method of selecting a sample from a population where every element has an equal chance of being selected. This method ensures that each unit in the population has an equal probability of being included in the sample.

Stratified random sampling: A method of dividing the population into subgroups, or strata, based on certain characteristics and then selecting a random sample from each stratum. This method is useful when the population is heterogeneous and there are significant differences between the subgroups.

Systematic sampling

Cluster Sampling

Sampling probability proportional to size
Multistage sampling

Non-Probability Sampling Methods

There are several non-probability sampling methods that can be used to select a sample from a population. These methods include:

1. Convenience Sampling: This method involves selecting participants who are easily accessible and available for participation.

2. Purposive Sampling: This method involves selecting participants based on specific characteristics or criteria.

3. Snowball Sampling: This method involves starting with a small group of participants and then recruiting additional participants through referrals from the initial group.

4. Quota Sampling: This method involves selecting participants to meet certain quotas or requirements, such as age, gender, or ethnicity.

5. Judgmental Sampling: This method involves selecting participants based on the researcher's judgment about who would be most likely to provide useful information.

6. Volunteer Sampling: This method involves selecting participants who volunteer for participation in the study.

7. Self-Selection Sampling: This method involves allowing participants to self-select into the study by choosing whether or not to participate.

Non-probability sampling methods are often used when it is difficult or impossible to obtain a random sample of the population, such as when studying rare or hard-to-reach populations. However, these methods can also be biased and may not accurately represent the population being studied.

Quota Sampling

Purposeful sampling, also known as judgmental sampling, is a non-probability sampling technique used in research studies. It involves selecting participants or cases based on specific criteria or characteristics that are relevant to the research question or hypothesis. This approach is often used when it is difficult or impossible to use probability-based sampling methods due to the nature of the population being studied or the availability of data.

In purposeful sampling, the researcher uses their judgment and expertise to select participants who best represent the phenomenon or issue being studied. The goal is to obtain a sample that is rich in information and provides insight into the research question or hypothesis. This approach can be particularly useful when studying rare or hard-to-reach populations, or when exploring complex phenomena that require in-depth understanding.

Some common methods used in purposeful sampling include:

* Convenience sampling: selecting participants who are easily accessible or readily available
* Snowball sampling: starting with a small group of participants and asking them to refer others who fit the selection criteria
* Homogeneous sampling: selecting participants who share similar characteristics or experiences

While purposeful sampling can be a valuable approach in certain research contexts, it is important to note that it may not provide a representative sample of the population being studied. Therefore, researchers should carefully consider the limitations and potential biases associated with this method when designing their study.

Sampling and Non-Sampling Errors

Data from sample surveys are subject to two types of errors: sampling and non-sampling errors. 

Sampling errors result from the fact that we only have information from a portion of the population of interest rather than from the whole population.

Non-sampling errors include errors from all other sources, such as:

the sampling frame
the questionnaire
the interviewer
and the respondent.

Data from both censuses and sample surveys may suffer from non-sampling errors, while only sample survey data are subject to sampling error.

Sampling and Non-Sampling Errors

Sampling errors are controlled by choice of the survey design. The size of the sampling error can be estimated using the survey data themselves. Sampling errors typically contribute to the variance of an estimate from sample survey data (and do not exist for census data), while non-sampling errors can contribute to both variance and bias of an estimate.

In collecting sample survey or census data, we try to control, reduce, or avoid non-sampling errors as much as possible because their size and effect on estimates are very hard to assess.

Major types of Non-Sampling Errors

Frame Error (erroneous inclusions, erroneous exclusions, and multiple inclusions)

Some units may have a higher probability of being included in the sample than most units. These errors may result in sample estimates that are biased for the population quantity being estimated.

For example, if wealthier households are more likely to have multiple phone lines, then those households are more likely to be included in the sample (if the sampling frame is the telephone directory). This could lead to biased (overestimated) estimates of, say, amount spent on entertainment.

Major types of Non-Sampling Errors

2. Response Error: occurs when a respondent intentionally or unintentionally gives an answer to a survey question that is not correct. Carefully designed and worded questionnaires, and, for in-person or telephone surveys, well-trained interviewers are the best tools for avoiding response errors. Questionnaires must be pilot-tested to ensure that respondents understand questions and that all possible responses are allowed for on closed-form questions.

Major types of Non-Sampling Errors

3. Nonresponse Error: (missing data or nonresponse)

There are two types of nonresponse in surveys and censuses: unit nonresponse and item nonresponse.
If no survey information is collected from a sampled unit, this is termed as unit nonresponse.
If a sampled unit responds to some, but not all, survey questions, this is termed as item nonresponse.
There are different methods for dealing with unit and item nonresponse.

Major types of Non-Sampling Errors

There are other sources of non-sampling error that can affect survey data. Errors caused by interviewer bias, survey mode, coding, and data entry are all errors that should be avoided in conducting surveys.

Unbiased estimator of a population parameter
The word "estimator" denotes the rule by which an estimate of some population characteristic μ is calculated from the sample results. The word "estimate" is applied to the value obtained from a specific sample.

An estimator $\hat{\mu}$ of $\mu$ given by a sampling plan is called <b>unbiased</b> if the mean value of $\hat{\mu}$, taken over all possible samples provided by the plan, is equal to $\mu$.

$E(\hat{\boldsymbol{\mu}}) = \sum_{i=1}^{v} \boldsymbol{\pi}_{i} \hat{\boldsymbol{\mu}}_{i} = \boldsymbol{\mu}$

where $\hat{\mu}_i$ is the estimate given by the $i$th sample.

CENTRAL LIMIT THEOREM (CLT)

• Central limit theorem is one of the most important theorems in statistics due to its applications in testing of hypotheses.
• Let S1, S2, ..., Sk be samples of size n drawn from an independent and identically distributed population with mean μ and standard deviation σ.
• Let X1, X2, …, Xn be the sample means (of the samples S1, S2, ..., Sk).
• According to the CLT, the distribution of X1, X2, …, Xn follows a normal distribution with mean μ and standard deviation σ/√n for large values of n.

CENTRAL LIMIT THEOREM (CLT)

That is, the sampling distribution of the mean will follow a normal distribution with mean μ (same as the mean of the population) and standard deviation σ/√n.

In simple terms, Central Limit Theorem states that for a large sample drawn from a population with mean μ and standard deviation σ, the sampling distribution of the mean, X̄, follows an approximate normal distribution with mean μ and standard deviation (standard error) σ/√n, irrespective of the distribution of the population (Thomas, 1984).

Alternative version of CLT

Let X1, X2, ..., Xn be n random variables that are independent and identically distributed with mean μ and standard deviation σ. Then for large n, mean X¯ = (X1 + X2 + … + Xn)/n follows a normal distribution with mean μ and standard error σ / √n.

Independent and identical distribution (IID) implies that the random variables are mutually independent and the random variables follow the same probability distribution.

Implications of Central Limit Theorem (CLT)

The variable $\frac{X-\mu}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}}$ will be a standard normal distribution (mean = 0, standard error = 1).

Regardless of the population distribution, the sampling distribution of large samples (<n > 30>) will follow the normal distribution with mean same as population mean and standard error $\sigma / \sqrt{n}$.

Central Limit Theorem for Proportions
If we have a population in which a characteristic (for example, smartphone users) has a proportion of p, then the sampling distribution of the proportion (that is, calculated from several samples of size n) will follow a normal distribution with mean p and standard deviation √[p(1-p)/n]
Then [hat{p}-p]/√[p(1-p)/n] will follow a Normal Distribution

Use of the Normal Distribution in Sampling Theory

We cannot know the exact value of the error of estimate (∉μ - μ) but, from the properties of the normal curve, the chances are 0.32 (about 1 in 3) that the absolute error |∉μ - μ| exceeds σ∈μ.

0.05 (1 in 20) that the absolute error |∉μ - μ| exceeds 1.96σ∈μ = 2σ∈μ.
0.01 (1 in 100) that the absolute error |∉μ - μ| exceeds 2.58σ∈μ.

Let me know if you need any further assistance!

Use of the Normal Distribution in Sampling Theory

For example, if a probability sample of the records of batteries in routine use in a large factory shows an average life $\hat{\mu} = 394$ days, with a standard error $\sigma_{\hat{\mu}} = 4.6$ days, the chances are 99 in 100 that the average life in the population of batteries lies between $\hat{\mu} = 394 - (2.58)(4.6) = 382$ days and $\hat{\mu}_{IJ} = 394 + (2.58)(4.6) = 406$ days. The limits, 382 days and 406 days, are called lower and upper confidence limits.

The Confidence Interval

"The '99% confidence' implies that if the same sampling plan were used many times in a population, a confidence statement being made from each sample, about 99% of these statements would be correct and 1% wrong."

Sample Size Determination for Mean of the Population
From the central limit theorem, we know that the sampling distribution of the mean follows a normal distribution with mean μ and standard deviation σ / √n. Then the standard normal variate of the sampling distribution of the mean is given by Z = (X - μ) / (σ / √n)

Note that the difference between the sample mean and the population mean, X̄ - μ, is an error in estimation of the population mean.

Sample Size Determination for Mean of the Population

Then,

n = |Zα/2 × σ/D|²

where Zα/2 known as the critical value is the value of Z for which the area under standard normal distribution is α/2 or (1 - α) is the desired confidence level in estimating the population mean and D = X̄ - μ is the error in estimating the population mean.

Sample Size Determination for Proportion of the Population
The sample size for estimation of population proportion is given by n = (∧α/2) / D)^2 × p^ hat × (1 - p^ hat)

Note: I left the math equation alone as per your instruction.

A hospital is interested in estimating the average time it takes to discharge a patient after the clearance (discharge note) by the doctor. Calculate the required sample size at a confidence of 95% and maximum error in estimation of 5 minutes. Assume that the population standard deviation is 30 minutes.

According to the government sources, 1% of 1000 rupees currency notes are counterfeit notes. If one would like to estimate the percentage of counterfeit notes in circulation within an error range of 0.001, calculate the sample size required at α = 0.01.
